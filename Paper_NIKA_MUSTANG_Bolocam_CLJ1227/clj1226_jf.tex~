%\textcolor{red}{Trimming my own notes now.}

In recent years, Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect observations have seen an increase in high resolution ($\theta \lesssim 30$\asecs)
observations \citep[e.g.][]{mason2010,adam2014,kitayama2016}. These observations come from MUSTANG on the
Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope \citep[GBT][]{dicker2008}, NIKA on the IRAM 30-meter telescope \citep{monfardini2010},
and ALMA, band 3 observations. However, all of these high resolution instruments have been limited in their ability to
recover signal at large scales (beyond $\sim 45$'asecs for MUSTANG and ALMA, and $\sim 100$\asecs for NIKA). As galaxy clusters
have characteristic radii, $R_{500} \gtrsim 3$\amin, SZ observations made with these instruments have not been able to recover the
entire signal of the observed galaxy clusters. Therefore, observations from SZ instruments which recover SZ at larger scales
such as Bolocam \citet{czakon2015} or Planck \citep{planck2013a} have been used in \citet{romero2015a} and \citet{adam2014} respectively.

These joint analyses have shown the ability to constrain the pressure profile of the intracluster medium (ICM) of individual
galaxy clusters over a large spatial range, often by assuming some parameterized pressure profile \citep[e.g.][]{romero2016,adam2014}.
In \citet{romero2015a}, the difference in fitted pressure profiles with the addition of MUSTANG data was noted. In the case of
\citet{romero2016,adam2014}, the pairs of instruments used did not have an overlap in scales of instrument sensitivity, so the
addition of another instrument would not necessarily present any discrepancies. However, as new SZ instruments with sensitivity to
a larger range of scales come online \citep{monfardini2014,dicker2014a}, there will be overlap, which for clusters observed with
multiple instruments, studies of the kinetic SZ effect, or relativistic corrections \citep{itoh1998} will be of significant interest and
stand to benefit from the additional frequency coverage. To be sure of the results of these analyses, it will be critical to
understand any systematics involved with individual instruments. Recent results combining Bolocam and Planck data \citep{sayers2016},
which overlap in regions of sensitivity, show non-trivial changes from previous Bolocam-only results \citep{sayers2013}.

Many SZ analyses thus far have focused on fitting a smooth pressure profile to their data; over a decade ago, the beta model
\citep{cavaliere1978} was used. While a self-similar \citep{mroczkowski2009} and analytical pressure profile based on a
polytropic equation of state \citep{bulbul2010} have been explored, the general Navaro-Frenk-and-White
\citep[gNFW][]{nagai2007} has garnered the most traction, with a fairly canonical set of parameters coming from
\citet{arnaud2010} (Hereafter, A10). While some SZ studies have attempted to deproject their data \citep[e.g.][]{sayers2013},
and fit pressure profiles to their deprojected data, the publication of non parametric pressure profile constraints have
been scarce. Investigating cluster pressure profiles non parametrically will show deviations from the smooth pressure profile,
which could be cause either due to systematics or inherent physical pertubations. That is, if we wish to better understand
discrepancies between SZ constraints, as discussed previously, investigating the non-parametric fits between instruments will
provide a viable route to this end. Independently, understanding pertubations within the cluster itself is also important in
the context of using galaxy clusters as cosmological probes.

Counts of galaxy clusters by mass and redshift serve to constrain cosmological parameters, notably $\Omega_{\Lambda}$,
the amplitude of fluctuations, $\sigma_8$, and the equation of state of dark energy, $w$. Constraints on these
parameters derived from galaxy cluster samples are generally limited by the accuracy of mass estimation of 
galaxy clusters \citep[e.g.][]{hasselfield2013, reichardt2013}. Scaling relations which relate global (integrated) observables
to the cluster mass are often employed. Currently, scaling relations as applied to observables over an intermediate radial
region of galaxy clusters is preferred as this range shows minimal scatter in the scaling relations \citep[e.g.][]{kravtsov2012}
owing to the generally low cluster-to-cluster scatter in pressure profiles, found observationally and in simulations,
within this radial range \citep[e.g.][]{borgani2004,nagai2007,arnaud2010,bonamente2012,planck2013a,sayers2013}.
While the relative homogeneity of pressure profiles in the intermediate region is well evidenced, it remains important to
develop methods to derive non-parametric pressure profiles of clusters so that physical deviations are not artificially
smoothed by the adoption of a smooth parametric profile. 

This paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:obs} we review the NIKA, MUSTANG, and Bolocam observations and reduction. 
In Section~\ref{sec:ml_deproj} we address the method used to non-parametrically fit pressure profiles to each of the data sets.
%We present results from the joint fits in Section~\ref{sec:pp_constraints} and compare our results to X-ray derived pressures 
%in Section~\ref{sec:xray_comp}. 
Throughout this paper we assume a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_m = 0.3$, $\Omega_{\lambda} = 0.7$, and $H_0 = 70$ 
km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

%%% OLD TEXT:

%Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe and thus serve as ideal cosmological probes 
%and astrophysical laboratories. Within a galaxy cluster, the gas in the intracluster medium (ICM) constitutes 90\% of the
%baryonic mass \citep{vikhlinin2006b} and is directly observable in the X-ray due to bremsstrahlung emission. 
%At millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths, the ICM is observable via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect 
%\citep{sunyaev1972}: the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off of
%the hot ICM electrons. The thermal SZ is observed as an intensity decrement relative to the CMB at wavelengths longer 
%than $\sim$1.4 mm (frequencies less than $\sim$220 GHz). The amplitude of the thermal SZ is proportional to the integrated
%line-of-sight electron pressure, and is often parameterized as Compton $y$: $y = (\sigma_T / m_e c^2) \int P_e dl$, where
%$\sigma_T$ is the Thomson cross section, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $P_e$ is the electron
%pressure.
%At longer radio wavelengths, if relativistic electrons are present, parts of the ICM may emit synchrotron emission.

%\textcolor{red}{[I need to revise this paragraph.]}
%Cosmological constraints derived from galaxy cluster samples are generally limited by the accuracy of mass calibration of 
%galaxy clusters \citep[e.g.][]{hasselfield2013, reichardt2013}, which is often calculated via a scaling relation with 
%respect to some integrated observable quantity. Scatter in the scaling relations will then depend on the regularity of 
%clusters and the adopted integration radius of the clusters. Determining pressure profiles of galaxy clusters provides an 
%assessment of the relative impact and frequency of various astrophysical processes in the ICM and can refine the choice of 
%extent of galaxy clusters to reduce the scatter in scaling relations.

%In the core of a galaxy cluster, some observed astrophysical processes include shocks and cold fronts 
%\citep[e.g.][]{markevitch2007}, sloshing \citep[e.g.][]{fabian2006}, and X-ray cavities \citep{mcnamara2007}. 
%It is also theorized that helium sedimentation should occur, most noticeably in low redshift, dynamically-relaxed 
%clusters \citep{abramopoulos1981, gilfanov1984} 
%and recently the expected helium enhancement via sedimentation has been numerically simulated \citep{peng2009}. 
%This would result in an offset between X-ray and SZ derived pressure profiles if not accounted for correctly.

%At large radii ($R \gtrsim R_{500}$),\footnote{$R_{500}$ is the radius at which the enclosed average mass density is 
%500 times the critical density, $\rho_c(z)$, of the universe} equilibration timescales are longer, accretion is ongoing, 
%and hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE) is a poor approximation. Several numerical simulations show that the fractional contribution
%from non-thermal pressure increases with radius \citep{shaw2010,battaglia2012,nelson2014}. 
%For all three studies, non thermal pressure fractions between 15\% and 30\% are found at ($R \sim R_{500}$)
%for redshifts $0 < z < 1$. Additionally, clumping is expected to increase with radius \citep{kravtsov2012}, and is expected to
%increase the scatter of pressure profiles at large radii \citep{nagai2011} as well as biasing X-ray derived gas density high,
%and thus X-ray derived thermal pressure low \citep{battaglia2015}.

%However, the intermediate region, between the core and outer regions of the galaxy cluster, 
%is often the best region to apply self-similar scaling relations derived from HSE to describe simulations 
%and observations \citep[e.g.][]{kravtsov2012}. Moreover, both simulations and observations find low
%cluster-to-cluster scatter in pressure profiles within this intermediate radial range \citep[e.g.][]{borgani2004,
%nagai2007,arnaud2010,bonamente2012,planck2013a,sayers2013}.

%There are many existing facilities capable of making SZ observations, but most have
%angular resolutions of one arcminute or larger. In recent years, the SZ community has adopted the pressure profile
%presented in \citet{arnaud2010} (hereafter, A10), who derive their pressure profiles from X-ray data from the 
%REXCESS sample of 31 nearby ($z < 0.2$) clusters out to $R_{500}$ and numerical simulations for larger radii. The
%adoption of the A10 pressure profile has allowed for the extraction of an integrated observable quantity which,
%via scaling relations, can then be used to determine the mass of the clusters. In this paper, we use high resolution
%SZ data to test the validity of this pressure profile in our sample of 14 clusters at intermediate redshifts.

\textcolor{red}{I have to reword the SAMPLE subsection.}

CLJ 1226 is a well studied high redshift cluster \citep[e.g.][]{mroczkowski2009,bulbul2010,adam2015}. 
\citet{adam2015} find a point source at RA 12:12:00.01 and Dec +33:32:42 with a flux density of 
$6.8 \pm 0.7 \text{ (stat.)} \pm 1.0 \text{ (cal.)}$ mJy at 260 GHz and $1.9 \pm 0.2 \text{ (stat.)}$ at 150 GHz. 
This is not the same point source seen in \citet{korngut2011}, which is reported as a point source
with $4.6\sigma$ significance in surface brightness, and can be fit in our current analysis as a point source 
with a flux density of $0.33 \pm 0.13$ mJy. A short VLA filler observation (VLA-12A-340, D-array, at 7 GHz) 
was performed to follow up this potential source. To a limit of $\sim 50 {\rm \mu Jy}$ nothing is seen, 
other than the clearly spatially distinct radio source associated with the BCG at the cluster center 
(1 mJy at 7 GHz and 3.2 mJy in NVSS). In contrast, the point source found in \citet{adam2015} is fit to our 
data with a flux density of $0.36 \pm 0.11$ mJy. Given the slight increase in significance of the point source
from \citet{adam2015}, we adopt that point source location for our pressure profile analysis of CLJ 1226.
 
%%% K09 flux is 0.34 +/- 0.13 mJy in our maps. Now I've written it in. Jan 2016.

In the previous analysis of the MUSTANG data, \citet{korngut2011} find a ridge of significant substructure after 
subtracting a bulk SZ profile (N07, fitted to SZA data). They find that this ridge, southwest of the cluster
center, alongside X-ray profiles, are consistent with a merger scenario. However, in this work, we do not find
any significant substructure after fitting a bulk component.
%\textcolor{red}{[I will do an analysis with the point source found in Korngut+2011. The question is if I already 
%have the point source modelled (and to find it).}

\subsection{MUSTANG Observations and Reduction}
\label{sec:musobs}

The MUSTANG camera \citep{dicker2008}
on the 100 meter Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope \citep[GBT, ][]{jewell2004} with its angular resolution of 9\asec 
(full-width, half-maximum FWHM) is one of only a few SZ effect instruments with sub-arcminute resolution.
However, MUSTANG's instantaneous field of view (FOV) limits its sensitivity to scales larger than $1$\amin.
MUSTANG is a 64 pixel array of Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers arranged in an $8 \times 8$ array
located at the Gregorian focus on the 100 m GBT. Operating at 90 GHz (81--99~GHz),
MUSTANG has an angular resolution of 9\asec and pixel spacing of 0.63$f \lambda$ resulting in a FOV
of 42\asec. More detailed information about the instrument can be found in \citet{dicker2008}.

Our observations and data reduction are described in detail in \citet{romero2015a}, and we briefly review them
here. Absolute flux calibrations are based on the planets Mars, Uranus, or Saturn, nebulae, or the star Betelgeuse 
($\alpha_{Ori}$). Responsive detectors are determined by scans taken at regular intervals with a calibration lamp.
We fit and subtract a common mode template, polynomial, and sinusoid. Further data quality checks are calculated
after this subtraction. A transfer function was calculated in \citet{romero2016} when applied to white noise
across an entire sky. We find that said transfer function does not fully reproduce the results of a simulated
cluster observation. Therefore, we refine the the transfer function by filtering a cluster model based on a strictly
\citetalias{arnaud2010} profile (a gNFW profile with parameters
$[\alpha,\beta,\gamma,C_{500},P_0]=[1.05,5.49,0.31,1.18,8.42]$) through the standard MUSTANG pipeline and calculate
the transfer function. The principle difference between this new transfer function and the former transfer function
occurs at scales larger than the FOV (wavenumbers smaller than $\sim0.025$ inverse arcseconds).

%We verify the results of the transfer functions to the standard pipeline and find agreement,
%principally of the peak amplitude, within 10\%. To further
We verify the fidelity of the new transfer function by reproduce the analysis performed in \citet{romero2016} for CLJ1226,
with the use of the new transfer function in place of the standard MUSTANG filtering procedure.
In general, we find good agreement for the constraints on pressure profiles. More specifically, cluster models with
$0.5 < C_{500} < 3.3$ are well reproduced with fitted amplitudes that are within 10\% of those found in \citet{romero2016}.
Furthermore, the best fit profile shape parameters ($C_{500}$, $P_0$, and $\gamma$) are within $\sim10$\% agreement as well.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Bolocam Observations and Reduction}
\label{sec:bolocamobs}

To probe a wider range of scales we complement our MUSTANG data with SZ data from Bolocam \citep{glenn1998}. 
Bolocam is a 144-element bolometer
array on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) with a beam FWHM of 58\asecs at 140 GHz and circular FOV with 8\amins 
diameter, which is well matched to the angular size of $R_{500}$ ($\sim 4$\amin) of the clusters in our sample. 

Bolocam is a 144-element camera that was a facility instrument on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) from
2003 until 2012. Its field of view is 8\amins in diameter, and at 140 GHz it has a resolution of 58\asecs FWHM
(\citet{glenn1998,haig2004}). The clusters were observed with a Lissajous pattern that results in a tapered
coverage dropping to 50\% of the peak value at a radius of roughly 5\amin, and to 0 at a radius of 10\amin.
The Bolocam maps used in this analysis are $14\arcmin \times 14\arcmin$. The Bolocam data 
\footnote{Bolocam data is publicaly available at 
\href{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release\_2/ancillary-data/bolocam/}
{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release\_2/ancillary-data/} 
\href{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release\_2/ancillary-data/bolocam/}{bolocam/}.} 
are the same as those used in \citet{czakon2015} and \citet{sayers2013}; the details of the reduction are 
given therein, along with \citet{sayers2011}. 
The reduction and calibration is similar to that used for MUSTANG, and Bolocam achieves a 
5\% calibration accuracy and 5\asecs pointing accuracy.

\subsection{{\color{red}Overview}}
\label{sec:ml_overview}

\subsection{Preprocessing}

The mean level in the MUSTANG map is calculated as the mean within the inner arcminute MUSTANG noise map. The
point source is taken with the amplitude and location of that found in \citet{romero2016}. Both the noise and
point source are subtracted from the MUSTANG map before fitting a cluster model. The Bolocam map already had
its mean level subtracted.  The point source is faint enough to not be a concern for the Bolocam data given
Bolocam's beam. We do not subtract a mean level from the NIKA data, but we do subtract the point source as
fit in \citet{adam2015}.

\subsection{Non-Parametric Models}

We employ a spherically symmetric pressure profile as our galaxy cluster model. Our fitting algorithm is applied
to each dataset independently; therefore, cluster models are binned and gridded differently for each dataset.
Radial bins are defined so that
each bin is at least as wide as a beam width, with the additional constraint that the outer most bin is beyond
the FOV of the instrument. We define our radial bins based on the radii which confine the bins. Our first bin
covers the range $0 < r < R_1$; our second bin covers $R_1 < r < R_2$, and our last ($n$th) bin covers
$R_{n-1} < r $, i.e. it extends to infinity. However, a finite radius $R_n$ is defined. Pressure normalizations,
$P_i$, are defined at each bin boundary, $R_i$. We then assume that the pressure in between bin boundaries
follows a power law, $P \propto r^{-\alpha}$. We assume that the power law in the first bin is given by the power law of the second bin.
The power law of the outermost bin is determined from $P_{n-1}$ (at $R_{n-1}$) and $P_{n}$ (at $R_{n}$), and extended
to infinity. Given the integration along the line of sight, we put a prior on this outer bin such that $\alpha > 1$.
We note that under hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE), this should be limited to $\alpha >3$ in order to avoid having
infinite mass.

Given the restrictions of ellptical symmetry and a power law dependence of the integrated quantity (pressure) on the
elliptical radius, it is possible to calculate the integral along the line of sight analytically
\citep[e.g.][]{vikhlinin2001a,korngut2011}. We follow
principally the formulation provided in \citet{korngut2011}. As noted in \citet{sarazin2016}, there are certain power
laws ($\alpha/2 = p = 1/2, 0 , -1/2, -1, -3/2, ...$) for which the formulation given in \citet{korngut2011} fails,
but a reformulation provides a valid integration. More generally, the formulation fails for $\alpha/2 = p < -1/2$.
While a negative index indicates a rise in pressure with radius (atypical), this could arise, especially localised,
from shocks, for example. We also wish to minimise our restrictions on the power laws (between bins) so as to minimise
induced correlations between bins. Therefore, we implement extensions to the canonical formuation that allow us to
integrate within finite regions (spheres or shells that extend only to a finite radius). These extensions and
reformulations of specific half integers and described in Section~\ref{sec:analytic_integrals}.

\begin{equation}
  y = \frac{\sigma_T}{m_e c^2} \int P_e dl
  \label{eqn:compton_y}
\end{equation}

The integrated profiles, calculated as the Compton y parameter (Equation~\ref{eqn:compton_y}), are converted into
the units of the original data map. Maps are gridded by assuming a linear interpolation of the 1D (radial) profiles.
When gridding our bulk ICM component, we adopt the ACCEPT centroid of CLJ 1227.
These maps are then convolved with the respective beam and transfer function.

%We do not find significant changes in
%the fitted gNFW parameters (Section~\ref{sec:pp_constraints}), 

\subsection{Fitting Algorithm}

%\textcolor{red}{I need to review emcee and Matt's write-up.}
We employ a maximum likelihood algorithm, and take our noise to be Gaussian such that our likelihood is given
by:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} \ propto e^{-\chi^2 / 2} 
  \label{eqn:likelihood}
\end{equation}
and $\chi^2$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \chi^2 = (\overrightarrow{d} - \overrightarrow{d}_{mod})^T \mathbf{N}^{-1} (\overrightarrow{d} - \overrightarrow{d}_{mod}),
  \label{eqn:chi_sq}
\end{equation}
where $\overrightarrow{d}$ is our data, $\overrightarrow{d}_{mod}$ is our model, and $\mathbf{N}^{-1}$ is our
covariance matrix for a given dataset.

In previous works, NIKA and MUSTANG noise has been taken as uncorrelated \citep[e.g.][]{romero2015a,romero2016,adam2015}.
Bolocam noise has been taken as roughly uncorrelated, but 1000 noise realizations, which included CMB and point
source estimates, are provided to allow for a more accurate noise estimation \citep{sayers2011}.
%In \citet{romero2016},
%the 1000 Bolocam noise realizations were added to a best fit model (found assuming uncorrelated noise) to determine
%more appropriate constraints on fitted parameters.
We calculate the two-dimensional power spectrum for noise maps of each dataset and find that the noise is consistent
with white noise on the scales, for each dataset, which we wish to constrain the models.
\textcolor{red}{Do we want a figure of these?}

We calculate the final probability of our models by applying priors as prescribed by Bayes' Theorem.
%\begin{equation}
%  P(\overrightarrow{d} | \theta) \propto \mathcal{L}(\theta | \overrightarrow{d}) \text{Prior}(\theta)
%  \label{eqn:prior}
%\end{equation}
On each of the pressure bins, we assign strict priors that $P_i > 0$, and as previously mentioned, the last bin
has a prior that on its associated power law slope: $\alpha > 1$. We allow for the choice of including a prior
on the integrated Compton Y parameter \textcolor{red}{(Need to introduce this earlier / reference a section/equation.)}
from Planck data \citep{plank2014}. In particular, we take the prior given in \citet{adam2015}:
$Y_{cyl}(15\amin) = (0.94 \pm 0.36) \times 10^{-3} \text{arcmin}^2$.

We employ the described probability function in a python Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) package, emcee \citep{foreman2013}.
This MCMC package makes use of a variant of a Metropolis-Hastings (MH), in particular the ensemble sampling algorithm is
affine-invariant \citep{goodman2010}. This algorithm has the notable advantage of having a much shorter autocorrelation
time than a standard MH algorithm. 

\subsection{Parametric Fits: gNFW}
\label{sec:parfits}

\textcolor{red}{I need to introduce this better}

The cluster is taken to be a 
spherically symmetric 3D electron pressure profile as parameterized by a generalized Navarro, Frenk,
and White profile \citep[hereafter, gNFW][]{navarro1997,nagai2007}:
\begin{equation}
  \Tilde{P} = \frac{P_0}{(C_{500} X)^{\gamma} [1 + (C_{500} X)^{\alpha}]^{(\beta - \gamma)/\alpha}}
\end{equation}
where $X = R / R_{500}$, and $C_{500}$ is the concentration parameter; one can also write ($C_{500} X$) as
($R / R_s$), where $R_s = R_{500}/C_{500}$. $\Tilde{P}$ is the electron pressure in units of the characteristic
pressure $P_{500}$. This pressure profile is integrated along the line of sight to produce 
a Compton $y$ profile, given as 
\begin{equation}
  y(r) = \frac{P_{500} \sigma_{T}}{m_e c^2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Tilde{P}(r,l) dl
\end{equation}
where $R^2 = r^2 + l^2$, $r$ is the projected physical radius, and $l$ is the distance from the center of the cluster
along the line of sight. Once integrated, $y(r)$ is gridded as $y(\theta)$ ($\theta$ being the angular radius) 
and is realized as two maps with
the same astrometry as the MUSTANG and Bolocam data maps (pixels of 1\asecs and 20\asecs on a side, respectively). 
%From here, we produce two model maps: one for Bolocam and one for MUSTANG. 
In each case, we convolve the Compton $y$ map by the appropriate beam shape. For Bolocam we use a Gaussian with FWHM
$= 58$\asec, and for MUSTANG we use the double Gaussian as determined in \citet{romero2015a}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We developed an algorithm to jointly fit gNFW pressure profiles to clusters observed via the SZ
effect with MUSTANG and Bolocam. We apply this algorithm to 14 clusters and find the profiles are 
consistent with a universal pressure profile found in \citet{arnaud2010}. Specifically, the 
pressure profile is of the form:
\begin{equation*}
  \Tilde{P_e} = \frac{P_0}{(C_{500} X)^{\gamma} [1 + (C_{500} X)^{\alpha}]^{(\beta - \gamma)/\alpha}},
%  \label{eqn:norm_gnfw}
\end{equation*}
where we fixed $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to values found in \citet{arnaud2010}.

\subsection{{\color{red}Analytic Integrals of Elliptically Symmetric Power Laws}}
\label{sec:analytic_integrals}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Given the use of the gamma and incomplete beta functions, it is important to recognize its limitations.
Specifically, $\Gamma(x)$ is undefined for $x = -i, i \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ (negative integers, including
zero). Furthermore, $x = 0.5-i, i \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ is also not calculable here! Finally, all incomplete
beta functions are generally defined for $B(x,y)$ that $Re(x) > 0$ and $Re(y) > 0$. However, the relation:
\begin{equation}
  I_x(a,b) = I_x(a+1,b) + \frac{x^a (1-x)^b}{a B(a,b)}
  \label{eqn:recibeta}
\end{equation}
allows us to extend our function into the negative domain (for $a$, which we take as $P-0.5$). 

To deal with the limitation, generally seen as: $2*x-2 = -i, i \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$, we derive another approach, from:
\begin{align}
  I &= 2 \epsilon_0 A^{-2P} \int_{0}^{t_0}(1+t^2)^{-P} c A dt \text{ and now adopt } t^2 = \frac{u}{1-u} \\
    &= 2 \epsilon_0 A^{-2P} \int_{0}^{\theta_0}(1+\tan^2(\theta))^{-P} \sec^2(\theta) d\theta \\
    &= 2 \epsilon_0 A^{-2P} \int_{0}^{\theta_0}\cos^{2P-2}(\theta) d\theta
\end{align}

This must then be extended, and is done so with the relation:
\begin{equation}
  \int \cos^{n-2}(\theta) d\theta = \frac{n}{n-1}\int \cos^n(\theta)d\theta - \frac{1}{n-1}\cos^{n-1}(\theta)\sin(\theta) 
  \label{eqn:cosext}
\end{equation}
Given our values of interest/applicability ($2*x-2 = -i, i \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$), this extension is perfectly
applicable, and we will end in nice functions; either:
\begin{align*}
  \int \cos^n(\theta)d\theta &= \tan(\theta) \text{ for } n=-2 \text{ or: } \\
  \int \cos^n(\theta)d\theta &= \ln \vert \sec(\theta) + \tan(\theta) \vert \text{ for } n=-1
\end{align*}

The \textbf{only} place where this analytic integration fails is for $p < 0.5$ \textbf{when} integrating out to infinity,
which is fine, as this must diverge in any case [citation needed]. 


\section{Data Products}

We have made MUSTANG data products for the sample of clusters analysed in this paper available at:

Bolocam and ACCEPT data are available from this website as well. In particular, we have publicized the final
data maps, noise maps, and signal-to-noise (SNR) maps used in this analysis, as well as transfer functions
for individual clusters. Further documentation is available on the website.
