%\section{Sensitivity}

%\input{Sensitivity.tex}

In this section, we derive various quantities that relate to the
sensitivity of the instrument:

\begin{itemize}
\item The detector Noise Equivalent Flux Density $NEFD_{det,0}$ is the 1\,$\sigma$
  error on the flux of a point source as measured by a detector in 1~second of
  integration time.
\item The observer Noise Equivalent Flux Density $NEFD_{obs,0}$ is the 1\,$\sigma$
  error on the flux of a point source in 1~second of telescope integration time.
\item The mapping speed $M_s$ is the sky area that can be mapped at a noise
  level of 1\,mJy in one hour of telescope integration time.
\end{itemize}

Subscript $_0$ means that at this stage, we consider these definitions in
the absence of atmosphere. Corrections to account for elevation and opacity are
addressed later on. We first focus on these definitions and how to defined more
these quantities more technically in sect.\ref{se:integration_time}. Section~\ref{se:nefd_method}
presents several methods to estimate them. Results, together with robustness
tests are reported in sect.~\ref{se:nefd_results}.

\subsection{NEFD and mapping speed definitions}
\label{se:integration_time}

%% \nico{While the notion of ``observation time'' seems intuitively
%%   straightforward, it deserves a closer look when it comes to actually
%%   estimating it on data acquired with non continuous arrays of detectors. The
%%   NEFD is commonly refered to individual \emph{detectors} and must then be
%%   related to the whole \emph{instrument} to provide the observer with a mapping speed
%%   and a time estimator to plan observations.}


We distinguish the on-source \emph{detector} integration time $t_{det}$ from the
on-source \emph{observer} integration time $t_{obs}$. The former refers to the
cumulative time spent on-source by detectors, the latter to the cumulative time
spent on-source by the FOV overall as commonly considered when talking about the
``instrument being on-source''. To be even more concrete, assume that at some point during
a scan, the source is located on a region of the FOV where a few KIDs are blind: no
valid detector is actually seeing the source at this time, so $t_{det}$ is not
incremented while $t_{obs}$ is. $t_{det}$ is releveant for the estimation of detector
performances, $t_{obs}$ is relevant for astronomers when
designing scanning strategies and estimating the required observation time to
reach a given sensitivity, as we shall see in the following.

Let us consider a map of resolution $r$\,arcsec as obtained from
observations. The instantaneous $A$ covered by the FOV reads

\begin{equation}
A = \pi d_{FOV}^2/4 = N_{pix}r^2 = N_k g^2,
\end{equation}

where $d_{FOV}$ is the FOV diameter, $N_{pix}$ the number of map pixels inside
this area, $N_k$ the number of designed KIDs of an array
(Table~\ref{tab:number_of_kids}) and $g$ the distance between two adjacent
KIDs. Assume that the instrument remains fix on the sky for an observer time
$t_{obs}$, the total number of samples acquired during this time and spread on
the entire FOV is $\eta N_k t_{obs} f_{\rm{sam}}$ where $\eta$ is the fraction
of valid KIDs (tab.~\ref{tab:number_of_kids}). This leads to an average
observation time per map pixel

\begin{equation}
\langle t_{pix}\rangle = \langle N_{\rm{hit}}\rangle f_{\rm{sam}} = \eta N_k
t_{obs} f_{\rm{sam}}/N_{pix},
\end{equation}

and thus to

\begin{equation}
  t_{obs} = \frac{1}{\eta}\frac{\langle N_{\rm{hit}}\rangle_{\rm{center}}}{f_{\rm{sam}}}\,
  \frac{g^2}{r^2}.
\label{eq:t_obs}
\end{equation}

where we have added the subscript \emph{center} to specify that in order to
estimate $t_{obs}$ from the map, we take the number of hits per pixel at the map
center. In practice, we take the average of this number in a disk of radius
1\,FWHM to be immune to shot noise statistics in map pixels. The on-source
detector integration time then reads

\begin{equation}
t_{det} = \eta t_{obs}
\label{eq:t_det}
\end{equation}

If all KIDs are valid, $\eta$ equals 1 and the two integration times match, the
lower $\eta$, the lower the time actually spent on-source by detectors for the
same $t_{obs}$. An alternate way to derive $t_{obs}$ is to measure, during
observations, the amount of time when the source is at less than $d_{FOV}/2$
from the FOV center. This method gives values of $t_{obs}$ that agree with
eq.~(\ref{eq:t_obs}) to better than 5\%. In this work, we consider $t_{obs}$ as
given by eq.~(\ref{eq:t_obs}) because it is derived from the final map and can
therefore be generalized to any other place on the map than its center.

From these definitions and for the same $\sigma$ error on the measured flux of
the point source, we can now derive the corresponding NEFDs:

\begin{eqnarray}
NEFD_{det,0} & = & \sigma \sqrt{t_{det}} \label{eq:nefd_det},\\
NEFD_{obs,0} & = & \sigma \sqrt{t_{obs}} \label{eq:nefd_obs}.
\end{eqnarray}

Considering the surface covered by the FOV, we define the \emph{mapping speed}
as the surface that can be mapped at a given sensitivity in a certain
observation time and which reads

\begin{equation}
M_s = \eta \, \frac{\pi}{4} d_{\rm{FoV}}^2 \, \frac{1}{(NEFD_{det,0})^2}
\label{eq:mapping_speed}
\end{equation}

\subsection{NEFD estimation methods and scan selection}
\label{se:nefd_method}

We have devised three complementary methods for the
NEFD estimation, which come in two different flavours. First, we
use deep integrations on faint sources, and second we resort to 
joint analysis of multiple scans without combining them.\\
%% An
%% extensive discussion of these methods will be given in
%% \citet{Ponthieu2019}. In this section, we briefly describe one method
%% for each of the two approaches: \\

\noindent \emph{Deep integration method:} The error on the flux density of a
point source for an integration time $t_{det}$ \nico{at an elevation $el$ and
  with opacity $\tau$ is $\sigma_\phi(t) = NEFD_{det,0}\,e^{\tau/\sin
    el}/\sqrt{t_{det}}$}. Using long-time integration observation on a source,
we can study the decrease of $\sigma_\phi$ with integration time, and
therefore estimate the NEFD if the different elevation and opacity conditions of
observations are correctly accounted for.  We produce a series of maps using an
inverse-variance co-addition of more and more observation scans, and perform a
photometric analysis on each map according to Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}. Since
all the scans are not acquired in the exact same conditions of atmospheric
opacity and observing elevation, they do not contribute with the same weight to
the co-addition. \nico{In such case, eq.~(\ref{eq:nefd_det}) generalizes to}

\begin{equation}
  \sigma(n) = \frac{NEFD_{det,0}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}t_i e^{-2\tau_i/\sin\elev_i}}},
  \label{eq:sigma_tau_w8}
\end{equation}
where $t_i$, $\tau_i$ and $\elev_i$ are the integration time, the zenith
opacity and the observing elevation of the $i$-th scan of the $n$-scan
co-addition. \nico{Fitting $\sigma(n)$ vs the corresponding effective
  integration time $\sum_{i=1}^{n}t_i e^{-2\tau_i/\sin\elev_i}$ provides an
  estimate of $NEFD_{det,0}$. This method requires long integration on a same
  object. During the N2R9 run, we selected \hls\, a moderately faint source
  \citep{2012A&A...538L...4C}, expected to be 74.5\,mJy at 1mm and 15.7\,mJy at 2mm
  (M.~Bethermin, private communication). It has been observed for about 9\,h in
  total over three nights using 8x5~arcmin$^2$ OTF scans of various
  orientations.}\\

\noindent \emph{Scatter method:} Performing photometry on each individual scan,
we can estimate the sensitivity on the central flux and measure the time of
integration using Eq.~\ref{eq:t_det}, hence derive the NEFD per scan
scan. After correction of the attenuation of the atmosphere, the joint analysis
of a series of scans, \nico{even of different point sources,} provides us with
an estimate of the top-of-atmosphere NEFD. The selection of the source target
for the NEFD derivation is primarily based on the flux density. Indeed, noise
characterization may be biased by residuals of a strong source and the
instrument far side lobes. For this method, we therefore restrict the
analysis to sources with a flux below 1\,Jy.

\subsection{NEFD estimation and robustness tests}
\label{se:nefd_results}

%  comparison entre methods
First we test the stability of the NEFD estimates using the two
methods on a same data set. In Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods}, we
present an application of the deep integration method (left panel) and
the scatter method (right panel) on
%the NEFD estimates for Array 1, 3, the combination of A1$\&$A3
%and Array 2 using
the series of \hls\ observation scans.

The left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} shows the flux density
uncertainties as a function of the integration time. This plot has
been obtained as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}. The small
variations of the slope of the $1\sigma$ flux errors, which are
visible on the plot, correspond to variations of line-of-sight opacity
during the integration. These variations are taken into account for
evaluating the top-of-atmosphere NEFD using
Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma_tau_w8}. The NEFD estimates for Array 1, 3, the
combination of A1$\&$A3 and Array 2 using the deep  
integration method are given in the first row of
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.
 
\begin{table}[!htbp]

  N2R12, N2R14. The results given in the last row are based on more
  than a thousand scans, which distribute as 202, 481 and 430 scans of
  N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14 respectively.}

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In addition, we verify that the noise integrates down as expected with
respect to the integration time. Black lines in the left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} show the $1\sigma$ error fit with the
inverse of the square root of the integration time. The noise
integration is well consistent with $t^{-1/2}$.

The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} show the NEFD
estimates for  Array 1, 3, the combination of A1$\&$A3 and Array 2
using the scatter method, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method},
as a function of the line-of-sight opacities, $\tau/sin(\elev)$,
where $\tau$ is the zenith opacity and $\elev$ the observing
elevation. The solid lines show the best fit of the model for a
background-dominated sensitivity,
defined as NEFD = NEFD$_0$ exp${[\tau/sin(\elev)]}$. The best-fitting
NEFD$_0$ amplitude give us estimates of the
top-of-atmosphere NEFD, which are gathered in
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

We observe systematically higher NEFD for A1 compared to
A3, which is a mainly due to the dichroic-induced 'shadow effect' that
also impacts the flat fields, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field}. Furthermore, the NEFDs are well consistent
with being background dominated for each array and each observing
wavelength. 

%  comparison entre datasets
As a second robustness test, we check the stability of the NEFD for
three observation campaigns. Figure~\ref{fig:nefdvsbackground_below_1Jy} shows the
measured NEFD using the scatter method (see Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}) for the
sub-Jansky sources acquired at the N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14
campaigns. The NEFD estimates for the
three campaigns are in agreement within uncertainties for the whole
range of line-of-sight opacities that have been tested.
The solid lines show the expected dependance with
exp${[\tau/sin(\elev)]}$ for a background-limited sensitivity
model. Since the measured NEFD are not Gaussian distributed, we
derive the top-of-atmosphere NEFD as the median of the measured NEFD
per scans after correction of the atmospheric attenuation, which provides us
with a more robust estimate compared to a fit. The NEFD$_0$ estimates
are given in Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

Combining the data set of N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14 campaigns,
more than one thousand observations scans of sub-Jy sources meet the
baseline selection criteria (see Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}),
providing us with robust NEFD estimates that are representative of
average NIKA2 performance, which are gathered in
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_astro}.
The RMS uncertainties are evaluated as the rms scatter of the
individual NEFD estimates after correction with
$\exp[\tau/sin(\elev)]$. These values are then extrapolated at the
reference IRAM observing conditions, which consists of $2~\rm{mm}$
of precipitable water vapor (pwv) in the atmosphere and $60$ degrees
elevation.
