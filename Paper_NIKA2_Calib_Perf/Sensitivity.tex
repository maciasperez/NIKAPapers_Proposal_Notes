%\section{Sensitivity}
%\label{se:sensitivity}
%\input{Sensitivity.tex}

In this section, we derive the on-sky sensitivity of the instrument using a
large amount of observation scans, including deep integration on faint sources,
and assess the stability of our results against the observing conditions. We
evaluate the noise equivalent flux density (NEFD hereafter). To further estimate
the mapping capabilities, we also derive the mapping speed. We first discuss the
definitions and the technical derivation of these quantities in
Sect.\ref{se:integration_time} from measurements. Then, we briefly present
several estimation methods that have been considered and the data sets that have
been selected in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}.  Results, together with robustness
tests, are reported in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_results}.

%In this section, we derive various quantities that relate to the
%sensitivity of the instrument:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The detector Noise Equivalent Flux Density $NEFD_{det,0}$ is the 1\,$\sigma$
%  error on the flux of a point source as measured by a detector in 1~second of
%  integration time.
%\item The observer Noise Equivalent Flux Density $NEFD_{obs,0}$ is the 1\,$\sigma$
%  error on the flux of a point source in 1~second of telescope integration time.
%\item The mapping speed $M_s$ is the sky area that can be mapped at a noise
%  level of 1\,mJy in one hour of telescope integration time.
%\end{itemize}
%Subscript $_0$ means that at this stage, we consider these definitions in
%the absence of atmosphere. Corrections to account for elevation and opacity are
%addressed later on. We first focus on these definitions and how to defined more
%these quantities more technically in
%sect.\ref{se:integration_time}. Section~\ref{se:nefd_method}
%presents several methods to estimate them. Results, together with robustness
%tests are reported in sect.~\ref{se:nefd_results}.

\subsection{NEFD and mapping speed definitions}
\label{se:integration_time}

%% \nico{While the notion of ``observation time'' seems intuitively
%%   straightforward, it deserves a closer look when it comes to actually
%%   estimating it on data acquired with non continuous arrays of detectors. The
%%   NEFD is commonly refered to individual \emph{detectors} and must then be
%%   related to the whole \emph{instrument} to provide the observer with a mapping speed
%%   and a time estimator to plan observations.}
The Noise Equivalent Flux Density (NEFD) is the $1\,\sigma$ error on the flux
density of a point source in one second of integration time, considered on top
of the atmosphere. At this stage, consider a map of point source located at its
center, that observed under zero opacity. The estimation of the flux uncertainty
$\sigma$ is described in Sect.~\ref{blabal} \nico{double check the presentation
  of sigmaboost and error estimation}. We here derive the integration time from
actual observations. Indeed, it is not simply the duration of a scan, it depends
on the KID distribution in the FOV and the scanning strategy. The map has a
$r$~arcsec resolution. The hit map $N_{\rm{hit}}$ counts the number of data
samples per pixel. From this, we derive the integration time at the center of
the map as
%The instantaneous $A$ covered by the FOV reads
%
%\begin{equation}
%A = \pi d_{FOV}^2/4 = N_{pix}r^2 = N_k g^2,
%\end{equation}
%
%where $d_{FOV}$ is the FOV diameter, $N_{pix}$ the number of map pixels inside
%this area, $N_k$ the number of designed KIDs of an array
%(Table~\ref{tab:number_of_kids}) and $g$ the distance between two adjacent
%KIDs. Assume that the instrument remains fix on the sky for an observer time
%$t_{obs}$, the total number of samples acquired during this time and spread on
%the entire FOV is $\eta N_k t_{obs} f_{\rm{sam}}$ where $\eta$ is the fraction
%of valid KIDs (tab.~\ref{tab:number_of_kids}). This leads to an average
%observation time per map pixel
\begin{equation}
t_{\rm{center}} = \frac{\langle N_{\rm{hit}}\rangle_{\rm{center}}}{f_{\rm{sam}}}\,,
\end{equation}

where $f_{\rm{sam}}$ is the sampling frequency and $\langle
N_{\rm{hit}}\rangle_{\rm{center}}$ is the average of the hit map taken in a disk
of radius of one FWHM to be immune to shot noise statistics in individual map
pixels. Correcting this quantity from the density of detectors per map pixel at
the same time, gives the on-source \emph{detector} integration time, in other
words, the time when the source is actually being observed, by at least one
detector:

\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm{det}} = t_{\rm{center}}\, \frac{g^2}{r^2}\,.
\label{eq:t_det}
\end{equation}

In eq.~(\ref{eq:t_det}), $g$ is the distance between adjacent KIDs in the FOV
(Sect.~\ref{se:grid_distortion}). $t_{\rm{det}}$ matches the total duration of
the scan if the scanning strategy is designed so that the source is always in
the FOV and if the FOV is full of valid KIDs. Thus, the NEFD reads:

\begin{equation}
  \rm{NEFD} = \sigma \sqrt{t_{\rm{det}}}\; [\rm{mJy.s}^{1/2}].
\end{equation}

The mapping speed, $M_{\rm{s}}$, is the sky area $\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}$ that
can be mapped at a noise level $\Delta_\sigma$ of $1\,\rm{mJy}$ in an
integration time $\Delta_t$ of one hour. Noting $d_{\rm{FOV}} =
6.5\,\rm{arcmin}$ the FOV diameter and $\eta$ the fraction of valid KIDs for an
observation, the mapping speed reads

\begin{equation}
M_{\rm{s}} = \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}}{\Delta_\sigma\Delta_t} = 
\eta \, \frac{\pi}{4} d_{\rm{FOV}}^2 \, \frac{1}{\rm{NEFD}^2}\; [\rm{arcmin}^2.\rm{mJy}^{-2}.\rm{h}^{-1}].
\label{eq:mapping_speed}
\end{equation}

In real observation conditions, correcting the measured flux for opacity effects
according to eq.~(\ref{eq:uncorr_flux}) increases (degrades) the effective
sensitivity like

\begin{equation}
\rm{NEFD}_{\tau,el} = \rm{NEFD}\, e^{\taunu x}
\label{eq:nefd_tau_el}
\end{equation}

Using these definitions, the integration time required to reach a target flux
density uncertainty $\sigma_{obs}$ over an area $\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}$ around
an airmass $x$ and under an opacity $\taunu$ is
\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm{obs}} = \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}}{ M_{\rm{s}}} \, \left(\frac{e^{\taunu\, x}}{\sigma_{obs}}\right)^2.
\end{equation}


\subsection{NEFD estimation methods and scan selection}
\label{se:nefd_method}

We have developed several complementary methods for the
NEFD estimation, which come in two different flavours. First, we
use deep integrations on faint sources, and second we resort to 
joint analysis of multiple scans without combining them. A detailed
description of our methods will be found in \citet{Ponthieu2019}.
%% An
%% extensive discussion of these methods will be given in
%% \citet{Ponthieu2019}. In this section, w
We briefly describe here one method for each of the two approaches. \\

\noindent \emph{Deep integration method} The error on the flux density of a
point source for an integration time $t_{det}$ at an \airmass\ $x$
and an atmospheric opacity $\taunu$ is
$\sigma(t) = \rm{NEFD}\,e^{\taunu \, x}/\sqrt{t_{\rm{det}}}$.
Using long-time integration observation on a source, we can study the
decrease of $\sigma$ with integration time, and
therefore estimate the NEFD when the different elevation and opacity conditions of
observation are correctly accounted for.  We produce a series of maps using an
inverse-variance co-addition of an increasing number of observation
scans, and perform a photometric analysis on each map according to
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}. Since
all the scans are not acquired in the same conditions of atmospheric
opacity and observing elevation, they do not contribute with the same
weight to the co-addition. In such case, an effective integration time
for the co-addition of $n$ scans is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
t_{\rm{eff}}(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\, t_i\,  e^{-2\taunu^i\, x_i},
\label{eq:sigma_tau_w8}
\end{equation}
%
where $t_i$, $\taunu^i$ and $x_i$ are the integration time, the zenith
opacity and the \airmass\ of the $i$-th scan of the $n$-scans
co-addition. Generalizing Eq.~\ref{eq:nefd_det},
the flux density uncertainties on the co-addition of $n$ scans is
$\sigma(n) = \rm{NEFD}/\sqrt{t_{\rm{eff}}(n)}$. An estimate of the
NEFD can therefore be obtained in fitting
$\sigma(n)$ as a function of the corresponding $t_{\rm{eff}}(n)$. This
method requires long integration time
on a same object. With this goal, during the N2R9 run, we selected \hls, a
moderately faint source
\citep{2012A&A...538L...4C}, expected to have flux densities of 74.5\,mJy at $1\,\rm{mm}$
and 15.7\,mJy at $2\, \rm{mm}$. %(M.~Bethermin, private
%communication).
It has been observed for about 9\,h in
total over three nights using $8 \times 5$~arcmin$^2$ OTF raster scans of various
orientations.\\

\noindent \emph{Scatter method} Performing photometry on each individual scan,
we can estimate the sensitivity on the central flux and measure the time of
integration using Eq.~\ref{eq:t_det}, hence derive the NEFD per
scan. After correction of the attenuation of the atmosphere, the joint
analysis of a series of scans, even towards different point sources, provides 
an estimate of the NEFD. The selection of the source target
for the NEFD derivation is primarily based on the flux density. Indeed, noise
characterization may be biased {\lp by the signal of a bright source
stemming from the most extended error beams and far side lobes.}
%by residuals of a strong source and the
%instrument far side lobes.
For this method, we therefore restrict the
analysis to sources with flux below 1\,Jy.

\subsection{Results and robustness tests}
\label{se:nefd_results}

%  comparison entre methods
First we test the stability of the NEFD estimates using the two
methods on the same data set. In Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods}, we
present an application of the deep integration method (left panel) and
the scatter method (right panel) on
%the NEFD estimates for Array 1, 3, the combination of A1$\&$A3
%and Array 2 using
the series of \hls\ observation scans.

The left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} shows the flux density
uncertainties as a function of the integration time. This plot has
been obtained as discussed in the previous section. The small
variations of the slope of the $1\sigma$ flux errors, which are
visible on the figure for each band, correspond to variations of line-of-sight opacity
during the integration. These variations are taken into account for
evaluating the NEFD using Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma_tau_w8}. The NEFD estimates for Array 1, 3, the
combination of A1$\&$A3 and Array 2 using the deep  
integration method are given in the first row (labeled 'Deep int') of
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

In addition, we verify that the noise scales down as expected with
respect to the integration time. Black lines in the left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} show the $1\, \sigma$ error fit with the
inverse of the square root of the integration time. The noise
integration is well consistent with $t^{-1/2}$.

The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} shows the NEFD
estimates for  Array 1, 3, the combination of A1$\&$A3 and Array 2
using the scatter method, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method},
as a function of the line-of-sight opacities $\taunu\,x $.
%,where $\tau$ is the zenith opacity and $\elev$ the observing
%elevation.
The solid lines show the best fit of the model for a sky
background-dominated sensitivity,
defined as NEFD($\taunu$, $x$) = NEFD exp${[\taunu\, x]}$. The
best-fitting NEFD amplitudes give us the estimates of the
top-of-atmosphere NEFD, which are gathered in
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

We observe systematically higher NEFD for A1 compared to
A3, which is a mainly due to the dichroic-induced 'shadow effect' that
also impacts the flat fields, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field}.
The dichroic-induced effect, which also impacts
A3, explains part of the NEFD difference between the $1\, \rm{mm}$ and
$2\, \rm{mm}$ channels, together with the higher atmospheric noise and
lower telescope beam efficiency at $1\, \rm{mm}$ with respect to
$2\,\rm{mm}$ wavelength.   
Furthermore, the NEFDs evolution with the sky noise is well consistent
with expectations for each array and each observing
wavelength. 

%  comparison entre datasets
As a second robustness test, we check the stability of the NEFD for
three observation campaigns. Figure~\ref{fig:nefdvsbackground_below_1Jy} shows the
measured NEFD using the scatter method (see Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}) for the
sub-Jansky sources acquired at the N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14
campaigns. The NEFD estimates for the
three campaigns are in agreement within uncertainties for the whole
range of line-of-sight opacities that have been tested.
The solid lines show the expected dependance with
exp${[\taunu\,x]}$ for a background-limited sensitivity
model. Since the measured NEFD are not Gaussian distributed, we
derive the top-of-atmosphere NEFD as the median of the measured NEFD
per scans after correction of the atmospheric attenuation, which provides us
with a more robust estimate compared to a fit. The NEFD estimates
are given in Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

Combining the data set of N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14 campaigns,
more than one thousand observations scans of sub-Jy sources meet the
baseline selection criteria (see Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}),
providing robust NEFD estimates that are representative of the
average NIKA2 performance. These NEFD estimates are gathered in
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_astro}.
The rms uncertainties are evaluated as the rms scatter of the
individual NEFD estimates after correction with
$\exp[\taunu\,x]$. These values are then extrapolated to the IRAM
\trentemetre\ telescope reference Winter observing conditions: $2\,\rm{mm}$
of precipitable water vapor (pwv) and $60$ degrees elevation.
%These
%correspond to Winter observing conditions at the IRAM
%\trentemetre\ telescope site.



%% \subsubsection{Mapping speed}
%% 
%% To further estimate the mapping capabilities, we also evaluate the
%% mapping speed $M_{\rm{s}}$, which is defined as the sky area
%% $\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}$ that can
%% be mapped at a noise level $\Delta_\sigma$ of $1\,\rm{mJy}$ in an
%% integration time $\Delta_t$ of one hour, using
%% \begin{equation}
%% M_{\rm{s}} = \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}}{\Delta_\sigma\Delta_t} = \eta \, \frac{\pi}{4} d_{\rm{FoV}}^2 \, \frac{1}{\rm{NEFD}^2},
%% \end{equation}
%% where $d_{\rm{FoV}} = 6.5'$ is the FoV diameter, $\eta$ the
%% fraction of valid KIDs, as given in Tab.~\ref{tab:number_of_kids} in
%% Sect.~\ref{se:fov_geometry}. This indicates the speed at which the sky
%% can be surveyed at a flux density rms error level of $1\,\rm{mJy}$.

From the NEFD estimates, we derive the mapping speed estimates using
Eq.~\ref{eq:mapping_speed}, and their extrapolation at reference Winter
observing conditions at the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope site using
Eq.~\ref{eq:ms_extrapol}. The mapping speed estimates and rms errors
are given in Table~\ref{tab:nefd_astro}.
