Sub-millimetric and millimetric domains offer a unique view of the
Universe from nearby astrophysical objects, including planets,
planetary systems, galactic sources, nearby galaxies, to high-redshift
cosmological probes, \emph{e.g.} distant dusty star-forming galaxies,
clusters of galaxies, Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB).

Ground-based {\lp continuum} millimeter experiments have made spectacular progress in
the past-two decades thanks to the advent of large arrays of
high-sensitivity detectors~\citep{Wilson2008_AZTEC,
  Siringo2009_LABOCA, Swetz2011_ACT, Bleem2012_SPT, Monfardini2011_NIKA, Holland2013_SCUBA2,
  Dicker2014_MUSTANG2, Adam2017}. %, challenging the
%motivation for spatial experiments.
This fast growth will continue as experimental efforts are
driven by two challenges: improving the sensitivity to the
polarisation to detect the signature of
the end-of-inflation gravitational waves in the CMB, and reaching
arcminute angular resolution to exploit the CMB secondary anisotropies
as cosmological probes, and sub-arcminute resolution to unveil the
inner structure of faint or complex astrophysical objects and to map
the early universe down to the confusion limit. Furthermore, new
generation of sub-arcminute millimetric experiments, like NIKA2, which
combines high angular resolution with a high mapping speed and a large
coverage in the frequency domain, will achieve a breakthrough in

our detailed understanding of the formation and evolution of
structures throughout the Universe.

%In particular, it would allow us to study the inner structure of

%formation at low and high redshift, by studying the role of magnetic
%field at a sub parsec scale in our Galaxy, and mapping the dusty star
%forming galaxies up to redshifts equal to 6.

%Brief historic of the commissioning. \\
%The instrument commissioning was successfully completed in September
%2017.
%NIKA2 is now open to the scientific community and will operate

The New IRAM KID Array Two, NIKA2, is a sub-arcminute-resolution
high-mapping speed camera observing simultaneously a 6.5' diameter
field of view (FOV) in intensity in two
frequency channels centered at 150 and $260\,\rm{GHz}$ and in
polarisation at $260\, \rm{GHz}$~\citep{Adam2018}. NIKA2 was installed
at the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope in October 2015 with a partial readout
electronics, and operated in the final instrumental configuration since
January 2017. After a successful
commissioning phase that ended in October 2017, NIKA2 is
open to the community for science-purpose observations for the next
decade. NIKA2 will provide key observations both at the galactic scale
and at high redshifts to address a plethora of open questions, including
the environment impact on dust properties, the star formation processes
at low and high redshifts, the evolution of the large-scale structures
and the exploitation of galaxy clusters for accurate cosmology.

%NIKA2, which will provide unprecedented maps at low and high
%redshifts, ranging from the interstellar medium to the dusty star
%forming galaxies up to redshifts equal to 6, will be a key experiment
%to address plethora of open questions in astrophysic and cosmology,
%ranging from the understanding of the star formation process at low
%and high redshift to  and accurate cosmology with galaxy clusters 
%

At the galactic scale, progress in understanding the star formation
process relates to an accurate characterization of dust properties in
the interstellar medium (ISM). NIKA2 will provide the high-resolution
high-mapping speed dual-wavelength millimeter observations that are
required for the determination of the mass and emissivity of
statistically significant samples of dense, cold, star-forming
molecular clouds~\citep{Rigby2018}.
Deep multi-wavelengths surveys of nearby galaxies and of large areas
of the galactic plane also allows for setting constraints on
environmental-related variations of the dust properties.
Furthermore, NIKA2 observations are needed for a
detailed study of the inner molecular cloud filamentary structure that
hosts Solar-mass star progenitors~\citep{Bracco2017}, to
understand the evolution process that culminates in star
formation (see \emph{e.g.}~\citet{Andre2014} for a review). Ultimately, these
observations are also helpful to understand planet formation within
proto-planetary disks.

For cosmology, NIKA2 observations will have two major
implications. On the one hand, they represent a unique opportunity to
study the evolution of the galaxy cluster mass calibration with
redshift and {\lp dynamical state} for their accurate exploitation as cosmological probe. 
Galaxy clusters are efficiently detected via the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect~\citep{SZ1970} up to high redshifts {\lp ($z<1.5$)}, as was recently
proven by CMB
experiments~\citep{Hasselfield2013_ACT_SZ, Reichardt2013_SPT_SZ, Planck2016_SZcat}.
The exploitation of the vast SZ-selected galaxy cluster catalogues is
currently the most powerful approach for cosmology with galaxy
clusters~\citep{Planck_2016_SZ_cosmo}. However, the accuracy of the tSZ cluster
cosmology relies on the calibration of the relation between the tSZ
observable and the cluster mass and on the assessment of both its redshift
evolution and the impact of the complex cluster physics on its calibration. 
%Cosmological constraints can be drawn from tSZ-selected cluster
%samples by using either the cluster number counts or the angular power
%spectrum. It requires a high purity sample to avoid bias, and in
%particular the understanding of the distribution of matter within the
%cluster, and the evaluation of the scatter induced by disturbed
%systems in the relation between the tSZ integrated flux and the total
%cluster mass.
Previous arcminute resolution experiments only allowed detailed studies
of the intra cluster medium spatial distribution for low redshift clusters (z <
0.2). Sub-arcminute resolution high mapping speed experiments are
required to extend our understanding of galaxy cluster towards high
redshift~\citep{Tony2019}. \citet{Ruppin2018} has reported the first high-resolution
tSZ mapping of a galaxy cluster with NIKA2. Furthermore, NIKA2
capabilities for the characterization of high-redshift {\lp ($0.5<z<0.9$)} galaxy clusters
has been verified using numerical simulation~\citep{Ruppin2019}.

On the other hand, in-depth mapping of large extragalactic fields with
sub-arcminute resolution with NIKA2 will provide unprecedented insight
on the distant universe. %Combining high mapping speed and sub-arminute
%resolution is mandatory to

%purpose, the high-angular resolution, combined with high mapping
%speed, is key to reduce the confusion noise, which is the ultimate
%limit of cosmological surveys~\citep{Bethermin2017_simu}.
{\lp For this purpose, the high-angular resolution is key to reduce the
confusion noise, which is the ultimate limit of cosmological
surveys~\citep{Bethermin2017_simu}, while the high mapping speed allows
this irreducible noise level to be reached in the extragalactic field
map in a short integration time.}
This will help quantifying the star formation at $z \approx 5$, probing the whole
star formation evolution across cosmic ages and clarifying the
role of the dusty galaxies in the reionization of the
universe~\citep{Mancuso2016}. Moreover, NIKA2 observations will be critical for our
understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.

%(B\'ethermin et al. 2017, Geach et al. 2017).\\

The current generation of sub-arcminute resolution experiments also
include the Large APEX Bolometer Camera
(LABOCA~\citep{Siringo2009_LABOCA}) at the Atacama
Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12-meter telescope, which covers a
12' diameter FOV at $345\, \rm{GHz}$ {\lp at an angular resolution of about
19''}; AzTEC at the 50-meter Large Millimeter Telescope, which operates with a
single bandpass centered at either 150, 220 or
$270\,\rm{GHz}$~\citep{Wilson2008_AZTEC}, {\lp and which has a beam FWHM of
$18''$ in the latter band}; the Submillimeter Common User Bolometer
Array Two (SCUBA-2~\citep{Holland2013_SCUBA2,Dempsey2013_SCUBA2}) on the
15-meter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, which simultaneously
images a FOV of about 7' %at $850\, \mu\rm{m}$ ($353\,
%\rm{GHz}$) and $450\, \mu\rm{m}$
%($666\,\rm{GHz}$)
at $353\,\rm{GHz}$ and $666\,\rm{GHz}$ {\lp with a main beam FWHM of 13''
and 8'' in the two frequency channels, respectively}
; MUSTANG-2 at the 100-meter Green Bank telescope,
which maps a 4.35' FOV at 
$90\,\rm{GHz}$ {\lp with 9'' resolution}~\citep{Dicker2014_MUSTANG2, Stanchfield2016_MUSTANG2}.
Therefore, NIKA2 is unique
in combining an angular resolution better than 20'', an instantaneous FOV of a
diameter of 6.5' and multi-band observation capabilities at $150$ and
$260\,\rm{GHz}$.


Most of the other millimeter instruments consists of bolometric cameras. By contrast,
NIKA2 is based on the Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KID)
technology~\citep{Day2003, Doyle2008_LEKID, Shu2018_LEKID}. This concept has been
first demonstrated with a pathfinder instrument,
NIKA~\citep{Monfardini2010_NIKA, Monfardini2011_NIKA}.
Installed at the IRAM 30-m telescope until 2015, NIKA demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance~\citep{Catalano2014}, and obtained
breakthrough results
(see \emph{e.g.},~\citet{Adam2014, Adam2017_kSZ}.
NIKA has been crucial in optimizing the NIKA2 instrument and data
analysis. 

%Key tool for a large variety of astrophysical and cosmological
%purposes, from Kuiper Belt objects or moons in the Solar system to

%obsjectives are articulated around five ambitious guaranteed-time
%large programs [add a small paragraph per LP]\\
%
%These scientific program requires high performance standard in term of

%the system. We assess this performance using a large amount of
%technical and science-purpose data acquired since the full
%installation of NIKA2.\\

A thorough description of the NIKA2 instrument is presented in \citet{Adam2018},
along with the results of the commissioning in intensity based on the
data acquired during the two technical campaigns of 2017.
%
{\lp In the present paper, we propose a standard calibration method, which is
referred to as the \baseline\ calibration, to go from raw data to
stable and accurate flux density measurements.} 
%
%The present paper discusses in detail step-by-step data reduction,
%from the observations and raw data to the sensitivities and an
%assessment of the calibration accuracy, thereby discussing the pros
%and cons of different strategies to provide robust results.
%
%In this paper, we

%calibration.
%We describe a standard calibration method, which is
%referred to as the \baseline\ calibration, but we are also discussing
%the pros and cons of alternative methods, which may in fact in the
%future lead to even better calibration accuracy and stability.
Furthermore we assess the performance in intensity using a large
amount of data acquired between January 2017 and February 2018.
Regarding the performance of the polarization capabilities, their
assessment will be addressed in a forthcoming paper.
To achieve a reliable and high-accuracy estimation
of the performance, we perform extensive testing of the
stability along both the analysis methodological
choices and the observing conditions.
{\lp First, the methodological choices and hypothesis may have an impact on
the performance results and the systematic errors. At each step of the
calibration procedure and for each performance metrics, we compare the
results obtained using the \baseline\ method to alternative approaches to
ensure the robustness against systematic effects.}
Second, we check the stability of the results using a large number of
independent data sets corresponding to variable observing conditions.
%To achieve
%high-accuracy estimation of each key performance characteristics,
%we test their stability against the methodological choices by
%comparing various analysis approaches, and we check their stability
%againts the observating conditions using vast independent data sets.
Specifically, most of the performance assessment relies on data
acquired during the February 2017 technical campaign (N2R9) and the
October 2017 (N2R12) and January 2018 (N2R14) first and second
scientific-purpose observation campaigns. {\lp These observation
campaigns are referred to as the {\emph reference observation campaigns}.}
Each campaign consists of about 1300 observation scans lasting between
two and twenty minutes for a total observation time of about 150 hours. 
%This large data set
%acquired through a year enables for testing against time-evolution and
%observing-dependency of the performance.
