\subsection{Reference flux densities of the calibrators}
\label{se:ref_flux}

% HA text
The two main calibrators of NIKA2 are the giant planets Uranus and
Neptune. Mars can also be used as primary calibrator, but care must be
taken to use a flux corresponding to the date of the
observations. Secondary calibrators were also observed during the
commissioning campaign. 

\subsubsection{Uranus and Neptune}
For the flux densities of the giant planets, we use the ESA model from
\cite{ESAmodel}: Version 5 for Neptune and Version 4 for Uranus. 
Both models provide the planet brightness temperature in the
Rayleigh-Jeans approximation as a function of the frequency. The
resulting flux is therefore: 
\begin{equation}
S_{\nu} = \Omega \times \frac{2 \nu^{2} k T_{RJ}}{c^2}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the solid angle of the planet on the sky. Following
Bendo et al. (2013) {\bf REF} and correcting their equation 12 we have:
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \pi \frac{r_{e} r_{p-a}}{D^{2}} 
\label{eq:omega}
\end{equation}
where $r_{e}$ is the equatorial radius of the planet and $r_{p-a}$ is
its apparent polar radius, and $D$ the distance to the
planet. $r_{p-a}$ can be computed from the sub-observer latitude $\phi$
({\it e.g.} the latitude of the observed {\bf ?}  as seen from the planet in the
planet equatorial reference frame) and $r_{p}$ the polar radius of the
planet as:
\begin{equation}
r_{p-a} = \sqrt{r_{p}^2 \cos^{2}\phi + r_{e}^2 \sin^{2} \phi}
\end{equation}
All quantities to compute the planet flux are obtained from the NASA
Horizons web site \url{https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi}, and are
listed in table~\ref{tab:planetphysparam}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

     & Uranus & Neptune \\
\hline

\end{tabular}

\caption{Physical quatities used for the Uranus and Neptune fluxes
  computation (equation~\ref{eq:omega}. Ob-lat and delta are quatities tabulated by NASA
  Horizons system as a function of the date}
\label{tab:planetphysparam}
\end{table}

To compute the planet fluxes for a given date, we use the python
photometry package available at
\url{https://github.com/haussel/photometry}.
 
The model spectra are linarly interpolated in log space at the
reference frequencies of the NIKA2 bandpasses. Fluxes for all NIKA2
calibration runs are listed in table~\ref{tab:fluxPred}, together with
the expected variation between the start and end of a run. 

The Uranus and Neptune models have been compared to Planck
observations of these planets (Planck intermediate results LII, Planck
Collaboration in press). For Uranus, the model used in the comparison
is the ESA V2, and it is found to overpredict by 4K (about 4\%) the
observed RJ temperature at 143~GHz and to agree at 217 GHz, and
underpredict at 353 GHz. We use for NIKA2 calibration ESA model V4,
that predict a flux respectively -3.3\%, 0.3\% and 4.7\% higher in the
the 143, 217 and 353 GHz, that would lead to a percent
accuracy with respect to Planck observations. 

For Neptune, the same study compared Planck observation with the ESA V5
model, {\it i. e.} the same one used for NIKA2 calibration. For this
planet, temperatures are found to disagree at most by 5K, i.e 4.1\%,
with the same trend with frequency as observed for Uranus. All thing
considered, this study confirm that Uranus ESA V4 and Neptune ESA V5
models are accurate to 5\% for predicting planet fluxes. Calibration
values tabulated in table~\ref{tab:flucPred} show that the variations
of Uranus and Neptune over the duration of a typical NIKA2 run are
negligible compared to the model accuracy. On the other hand, not
taking into account the planet shape and orientation with respect to
the observer in the computations of its solid angle can lead to errors
between 1 and 2\% as illustrated in the Python notebook
\url{https://github.com/haussel/photometry/blob/master/notebooks/planet_fluxes.ipynb}
distributed with the software.

\subsubsection{Mars}
For Mars, we use the model of Belloche \&  Amri (2006) available at
\url{http://www.lesia.obspm.fr/perso/emmanuel-lellouch/mars/index.php},
with default parameters. Model output is computed at the two reference
frequencies of NIKA2, 150 and 260~GHz.

Fluxes of Mars are tabulated in table~\ref{tab:fluxPred}. In many
cases, the variations of Mars flux during the course of a run are
larger than the model uncertainty (5\%), and should be recomputed at
more frequent times.

%The asteroids Ceres and Vesta have been modeled by Muller et al (2014) in accounting for 
%size, shape, spin-properties, albedo, and thermal properties and in adjusting to PACS, SPIRE and HIFI observations

%Thomas Mueller has tabulated flux densities at different wavelengths, in particular at 1300$\mu$m, every five days

%spectrum expected for Ceres and Vesta. Their flux densities in
%Table~\ref{tab:fluxPred} are for this date. Over the five days of  run 9 (february 23 - 28), the
%flux densities  at 1300$\mu$m  have decreased by  3\% 
%for Ceres and  by 6\%  for Vesta in Muller's tables but we have not corrected for this effect in our analysis below.

The secondary calibrator MWC349A is a young Be star, part of a stellar binary system, surrounded by a disk. Its radio
continuum emission originates in an ionized bipolar outflow (Tafoya et al 2004).
MWC349 has been monitored with the  Plateau de Bure interferometer and VLA,
and shown to be stable in time and only slightly angularly resolved, making it a point source
for the 30-metre telescope. We have computed its flux densities at the NIKA2 reference frequencies 150 and 260 GHz with 
$S_\nu = 1.16\pm0.01 \times (\nu/100 \rm{GHz})^{0.60\pm0.01}$ provided by this monitoring
\footnote{http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/IS/IS2012/presentations/krips-fluxcalibration.pdf} and
 private communication by Krips (2017) (see SED in Fig.~\ref{fig:Krips2017}).

The secondary calibrator CRL2688 is an Asympotic Giant Branch star. Its radio continuum emission is mostly
from circumstellar dust and is somewhat extended  (Knapp et al 1994).
Its flux densities at $850\mu$m  and $450\mu$m  have been stable at the 5\% level as monitored by SCUBA2 in 2011-2012
(Dempsey et al 2013). We have extrapolated their flux densities to  150 and 260 GHz
with the power law $S_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}$ and index $\alpha=2.44\pm0.18$ derived from their SCUBA2 measurements.
