\section{Beam-variation hardened calibration {\color{blue} Laurence $\rightarrow$ Juan} }
%\label{se:allscan_calibration}

As discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}, observations during the
afternoon session or the morning session after observations close to the
direction of the Sun are deeply affected by the telescope-driven beam
size variation. For the baseline calibration presented in
Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration}, the made choice is to discard the
scans acquired during these periods.

However, in this section, we address the issue of calibrating in
telescope-driven unstable observing conditions. We discuss a method,
which relies on a beam-size-dependent photometric correction, to
calibrate while the beam size broaden.

We perform two case studies: Sect.~\ref{se:cal_democase} presents a demonstration
calibration assuming the beam is precisely monitored, whereas
Sect.~\ref{se:cal_pointings} addresses a practical calibration relying
on a beam monitoring using pointing scans.

\addparag{ demo case}

Fig.~\ref{fig:photocorr_demo_uranus_flux_fwhm} shows the
measured-to-expected flux density ratio of Uranus observations after
calibrating using the demonstration case of the beam-variation
hardened calibration.
