%Submillimetric domain: a unique thorough view of the Universe from
%planetary surfaces in the Solar System to early galaxies,
%high-redshift galaxy clusters and the Cosmic Microwave
%Background (CMB).\\
%Ground-based submillimeter experiments have made tremendous progress in the last
%decades thanks to the advent of large detector arrays, challenging the
%motivation for spatial experiments.\\
%The current experimental efforts are driven by two complementary
%challenges: the improvement of the polarisation sensitivity to detect
%primordial polarisation B-mode of the CMB and measure CMB lensing on
%one hand and on the other hand the increase the angular resolution to
%reveal the inner structure of astrophysical objects, such as
%high-redshift galaxies and galaxy clusters.\\

Submillimetric and millimetric domains offer a unique view on the
Universe from the nearby astrophysical objects to the high-redshift
cosmological probes, for scientific purposes that ranges from
planetary science to cosmology.

Ground-based millimeter experiments have made spectacular progress in
the past-two decades thanks to the advent of large arrays of
high-sensitivity detectors. %, challenging the
%motivation for spatial experiments.
This high-slope tragectory will continue as experimental efforts are
driven by two challenges: improving the sensitivity to the
polarisation for detecting the signature of
the end-of-inflation gravitational waves in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB), and reaching arcminute angular resolution to exploit
the CMB secondary anisotropies as cosmological probes, and
sub-arcminute resolution to unveil the inner structure of
faint or complex astrophysical objects and to map the early universe
down to the confusion limit. However, sub-arcminute
resolution needs to be combined with a high mapping speed and a large
spectral coverage to really revolutionize our detailed understanding
of the formation and evolution of structures throughout the Universe.

%In particular, it would allow us to study the inner structure of
%galaxy clusters (detected by Planck), and to get a new view on star
%formation at low and high redshift, by studying the role of magnetic
%field at a sub parsec scale in our Galaxy, and mapping the dusty star
%forming galaxies up to redshifts equal to 6.

At the galactic scale, progress in understanding the star formation
process relates to an accurate characterisation of dust properties in
the interstellar medium (ISM). High-resolution high-mapping speed
multi-wavelength millimeter observations are required for the
determination of the mass and temperature of statistically significant
samples of dense, cold, star-forming molecular clouds
[see e. g. Rigby2018].
Deep multi-wavelengths surveys of nearby galaxies and of large areas
of the galactic plane also allows for setting constrain on
environmental-related variations of the dust properties.
Furthermore, sub-arcminute millimeter observations are needed for a
detailed study of the inner molecular cloud filamentary structure that
hosts the Solar-mass star progenitors [see e.g Bracco 2017], to
understand the evolution process that culminates in star
formation [see André 2014 for a review]. Ultimately, these
observations are also helpful to understand planet formation within
protoplanetary disks.

For cosmology, sub-arcminute millimeter observations have two major
implications. First, they represent an unique opportunity to constrain the
evolution of the galaxy cluster mass calibration with redshift and
morphology for their accurate exploitation as cosmological probe. 
Galaxy clusters are efficiently detected via the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect up to high-redshifts, as was recently
proven by recent CMB experiments [cite ACT, SPT, Planck]. The
exploitation of the vast SZ-selected galaxy cluster catalogues is
currently the most powerful approach for cosmology with galaxy
clusters [cite Planck]. However, the accuracy of the tSZ cluster
cosmology relates on the calibration of the relation between the tSZ
observable and the cluster mass, and on the constrain of the redshift
evolution and of the impact of the complex cluster physics. 
%Cosmological constraints can be drawn from tSZ-selected cluster
%samples by using either the cluster number counts or the angular power
%spectrum. It requires a high purity sample to avoid bias, and in
%particular the understanding of the distribution of matter within the
%cluster, and the evaluation of the scatter induced by disturbed
%systems in the relation between the tSZ integrated flux and the total
%cluster mass.
Previous arcmin resolution experiments only allowed detailed studies
of the intra cluster medium morphology for low redshift clusters (z <
0.2). Sub-arcminute resolution experiments are required to extend our
understanding of galaxy cluster towards high redshift.

[ATTENTION COPIE]
Similarly, distant universe studies via deep surveys will
benefit from a large instantaneous field-of-view and sensitivity
to cover sky regions at the confusion limit. This results
in detecting dust-obscured optically faint galaxies during
their major episodes of star formation in the early universe
(B\'ethermin et al. 2017, Geach et al. 2017).\\

The current generation of sub-arcminute resolution experiments include
LABOCA, SCUBA2, MUSTANG2, AZTEX. All this instruments consists of
bolometric cameras. By contrast, the New IRAM KID Array Two (NIKA2)
utilizes Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KID). This concept has been
demonstrated with the NIKA pathfinder [PAPIERS]

NIKA2 is a high-resolution large field-of-view multi-thousand detector
camera operated at the 30-m IRAM telescope. 
%Fourth generation of
%imagers installed at the IRAM 30-m: after the single beam
%imagers, the 7-pixel camera of the late 90's and several versions of
%MAMBO. Unlike its predecessors, NIKA2 is based on KIDs. Validated with
%NIKA pathfinder.\\
%Brief historic of the commissioning. \\
The instrument commissioning was successfully completed in September
2017. NIKA2 is now open to the scientific community and will operate
for the next decade.

%Key tool for a large variety of astrophysical and cosmological
%purposes, from Kuiper Belt objects or moons in the Solar system to
%high-redshift galaxies and galaxy clusters. The main scientific
%obsjectives are articulated around five ambitious guaranteed-time
%large programs [add a small paragraph per LP]\\
%
%These scientific program requires high performance standard in term of
%mapping capabilities, sensitivity, angular resolution and stability of
%the system. We assess this performance using a large amount of
%technical and science-purpose data acquired since the full
%installation of NIKA2.\\


A thorough decription of the instrument is found in \citet{Adam2017},
along with the results of the commissioning in intensity based on the
data acquired during the two technical campaigns of 2017. Here, we
detail the dedicated procedures that we have developed for the
calibration and we assess the performance using a large amount of
data acquired between January 2017 and February 2018. To achieve
high-accuracy estimation of each key performance characteristics,
we test their stability against the methodological choices by
comparing various analysis approaches, and we check their stability
againts the observating conditions using vast independent data sets.
Specifically, most of the performance assessment relies on data
acquired during the February 2017 technical campaign (N2R9) and the
October 2017 (N2R12) and January 2018 (N2R14 )first and second
scientific-purpose observation pools. Each campaign consists of about
1300 observation scans lasting between two and twenty minutes for a
total observation time of about 150 hours. This large data set
acquired through a year enables for testing against time-evolution and
observing-dependency of the performance.

performance assessment in intensity. This outlines as follows:
Sect.~\ref{se:instru}-to-\ref{se:dataproc} give short summaries of the
instrumental set up, the observational modes and the data analysis methods
that have been used for the calibration and the performance
assessment. Sect.~\ref{se:geometry}-to-\ref{se:sensitivity} detail the
dedicated calibration methods, extract the key characteristic results
and discuss their accuracy and robustness. Namely, the field-of-view
reconstruction and the KID selection for science purpose are discussed
in Sect.~\ref{se:geometry}. The beam pattern is characterised in
Sect.~\ref{se:beam}, along with the main beam
full-width at half maximum and the beam

the atmospheric opacity. The methods that we have proposed to
calibrate are gathered in Sect.~\ref{se:calibration}, while
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry} presents the validation of these methods and
the calibration accuracy and stability assessment. The noise
