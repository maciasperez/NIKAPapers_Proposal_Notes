The dispersion of the detector responsivity across the field of view has been
characterized by estimating flat fields using the nominally focused
\emph{beammap} scans described in Sect.~\ref{se:fp_reconstruction}, because
\bms\ are properly sampled and map high SNR point sources (see sect.~\ref{se:beammaps}). We have
considered different kinds of flat fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item Main beam flat field: the flat field for the main beam, which is the far
  field of the telescope estimated for the sources. It is determined using the
  relative calibration factors \todo{XXXX obtained for the calibration in
    FWHM$_{0}$ ???? beam}
  discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:cal_HA}. These are defined as
  \begin{equation}
    G_k = \frac{S_{th}(\nu_0)\, e^{-\tau/sin(\delta)}}{A_k}, 
  \end{equation}
  where $S_{th}(\nu_0)$ is the expected flux of the source integrated in the
  NIKA2 bandpasses and derived at the reference frequency $\nu_0$,
  $\tau/sin(\delta)$ is the line-of-sight opacity measured using the
  \emph{skydip} method described in Sect.~\ref{se:opacities} and $A_k$ is the
  amplitude of a Gaussian of fixed FWHM fitted from the detector $k$ map (as
  $\phi$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:flux_per_beam_def}).
\item Forward beam flat field: the flat field for forward beam, which is the near field of the telescope determined for the sky noise, is estimated using the correlation factor of each detector to a median common mode estimated off-source.
\end{itemize}

Figures \ref{fig:avg_mbff} and \ref{fig:avg_fbff} show the average main beam and forward beam flat fields for the three arrays. These have been constructed by combining the normalised flat fields of five \emph{beammap} scans, which were selected by thresholding the line-of-sight opacity measured in the 1-mm band, such as $\tau/sin(\delta) \leq 0.85$. The distribution for the average flat fields are shown in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:avg_mbff} $\&$ \ref{fig:avg_fbff}.

We observe a sizable variation of the flat fields for Array 1 from the left-most
side to the right-most side of the FOV: this reveals a significant change of
Array 1 detector responsivities depending on their position in the FOV. Namely,
this effect, the origin of which is under investigation, mainly impacts the
left-most third of the array, which is referred to as the "shadow-zone''. This
variation of the flat field translates into a broadening of the
distribution. However, we verified that A1 flat field dispersions are in line
with the ones of Array 3 after the detectors within the shadow-zone were flagged
out using a crescent-shaped mask. The masked flat field distributions are shown
in green in Fig.~\ref{fig:avg_mbff} $\&$ \ref{fig:avg_fbff}, whereas shadow-zone
distributions are in red. In addition to the average flat fields, we further
characterize the flat fields for individual \emph{beammap}
scans. Fig.~\ref{fig:stddev_ff} shows the dispersion of the flat fields for nine
\emph{beammap} scans using either the whole FOV or masking the shadow-zone. The
dispersion estimates for this two cases are gathered in
Table~\ref{tab:flatfields}.
