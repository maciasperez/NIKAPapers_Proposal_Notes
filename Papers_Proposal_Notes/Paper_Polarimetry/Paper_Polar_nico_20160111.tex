	\abstract{Constraining observationally the magnetic field role in star formation process is one of the outstanding problem in millimeter and sub-millimeter astronomy of our Galaxy. %If these are sufficiently strong can support star-forming clouds and cores against gravitational collapse. 
Millimeter observations of Galactic regions is the purpose of the {\it NIKA} polarimeter. 

{\it NIKA} camera consists of two arrays of 132 and 224 detectors LEKIDs (Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors) observing the sky from the IRAM 30-meter telescope (Granada, Spain)  in two millimeter channels at 1.25 mm and 2.05 mm corresponding at the central frequency of 260 and 150 GHz, respectively. 

The {\it NIKA} polarization system, composed of a multi-layer half wave plate (HWP) and a polarizer, is placed at 300K in front of the {\it NIKA} cryostat window.  A polarizer is necessary because of the LEKIDs Hilbert geometry, which is intrinsically not sensitive to the polarization. The combined action of the continuously rotating HWP and the small time constant of the LEKIDs permits the simultaneous measurements of the three Stokes parameters (I, Q, U) on a same area of the sky.

%{\it NIKA} is the prototype of {\it NIKA}2, a camera with improved main performance operating at the same frequencies and installed at the telescope on October 2015. {\it NIKA}2 has polarization capability at 260 GHz; the HWP is placed at 300K and the polarizer is mounted in the 100 mK stage of the cryostat splitting the two orientations of the linear polarization on two matrix of thousands of pixels.
%In this context observations of galactic regions will be carried out with the 1.25 mm polarization channel of the dual-band {\it NIKA}2 camera, based on Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs) and installed at the IRAM 30-meter telescope (Granada, Spain) on October 2015. {\it NIKA}2 observes the sky at 1.25 mm and 2.05 mm corresponding at the central frequency of 260 and 150 GHz and it has polarization capability at 260 GHz. The polarization setup in the {\it NIKA}2 camera consists of a rotating achromatic half wave plate (AHWP) placed at 300K in front of the cryostat window and a polarizer mounted in the 100 mK stage of the cryostat in order to split the two orientations of the linear polarization on two matrix of thousands of pixels.  

%The purpose of the {\it NIKA}2 polarized channel is constrain the magnetic field role in star formation process, observing the dust emission of the Galactic regions.

This paper aims at discussing the performance of the instrumental setup, the polarized data reduction analysis and the calibration on several quasars and known extended sources observed during the observational campaign on February 2015. 
In particular we observe a good agreement comparing the measurement of the calibrator 3C 286 polarization angle at 1.25 mm and 2.05 mm, respectively, $\alpha_{Sky}$ = (29.0 $\pm$ 3.9)$^\circ$ and $\alpha_{Sky}$ = (27.7 $\pm$ 3.9)$^\circ$ with other experiments observing at millimeter wavelengths. 

%previous studies effectuated by XPol, which give $\alpha\rm_{Sky}$ = [37.3$\pm$0.8]$^\circ$ at 3 mm and $\alpha\rm_{Sky}$ = [33.1$\pm$5.7]$^\circ$ at 1.3 mm.

%For the strong and variable quasar 3C279 we found an agreement with recent observations by CARMA at 1.3 mm, the polarization angles are $\alpha_{Sky}$ = (35.9 $\pm$ 3.2)$^\circ$ and $\alpha_{Sky}$ = (31.9 $\pm$ 3.6)$^\circ$ at 1.25 mm and 2.05 mm, respectively.
We also observed known extended sources: Crab nebula, Orion-OMC1, M87 and Cygnus A. The averaged angle of the Crab nebula  measured where the polarization intensity $IPOL$ is bigger than 0.1 Jy/beam is $\alpha_{\rm Sky}$ = 143.7 $\pm$ 14.7 $^\circ$ at 150 GHz. The measured averaged polarization angle measured by {\it NIKA} in the OMC1 region of the Orion molecular cloud is $\alpha_{Sky}$ = (21.3 $\pm$ 3.6)$^\circ$ and  $\alpha_{Sky}$ = (22.1 $\pm$ 2.6)$^\circ$ at 2.05 and 1.25 mm, respectively, in agreement with Polka instrument observations.}

{\bf General comments:}
\begin{itemize}
\item check the consistency with grammatical time : preteric, past perfect,
  present...
\item avoid the [h] in the begin figure command, it splits paragraphs in counter
  intuitive ways and will be shuffled up again in the writing process and by the
  editor anyway.
\item Rewrite equation \ref{eq:mueller_mat} to have coherent notations with the data analysis
  section and to be clearer with the interpretation of the lab measurements (
  squares of 2
  theta vs 4 omega)
\item in the results section, we'll have to clearly define our conventions in
  terms of $Q$ and $U$ orientation on the sky.
\item let's call once and for all $\nu_P$ the rotation frequency of the HWP,
  $\omega = 2\pi\nu_Pt$ the HWP angle, $\psi$ the angle between the sky
  polarization $x$ axis and the analyse ($\alpha$ is already taken in the HWP
  Mueller matrix definition).
\item I've replaced ``template'' by HWPSS, it's more explicite and i'm 99\% sure
  it's been called so in previous EBEX proposals at least, so it would be
  familiar to readers.
\item Changer les titres des plots ``TOI'' qui sont en fait des cartes
\item Utiliser imview plutot que radecbarmap etc... il doit y avoir de quoi
  mettre les coordonn\'ees radec sur le display, j'en ai parl\'e avec Florian,
  si ce n'est pas le cas, je vais le faire rapidement. Il faut que les displays
  soient homogenes et on pourra gagner de la place sur les plots avec la barre
  et les sous-titres.
\item I've removed all the ``footnotesize'' in captions, we must stick to A\&A standard.

	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
{\color{blue} I have not corrected the introduction}\\

	Since it governs a number of physical and chemical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), interstellar dust plays a key role in the Milky Way. With a pressure comparable to thermal gas and cosmic rays, the Galactic magnetic field plays a crucial role in our Galaxy \citep{planckdust}.
	
	Dust polarization observations can be used to define the magnetic field direction projected onto the plane of sky, thus complementing our knowledge of the Galactic magnetic field, obtained via measurements of Faraday rotation, synchrotron emission and Zeeman splitting \citep{crutcher2010}.
%	Magnetic fields provide the pressure balance required to support the ISM against gravitational collapse on large scales, regulating the filamentary structures
Observations at far-infrared and sub-millimeter wavelengths have demonstrated that the thermal emission from dust grains is often partially polarized \citep{schle1998, brenda2000}, which is usually attributed to the partial alignment of the emitting grains by magnetic field. 

 PLANCK large-scale polarization maps at 353 GHz show a polarized thermal dust emission coming from the elongated grains aligned with the magnetic field. The dust polarization fraction $p$ is observed to range from zero to more than 15 $\%$ \citep{planckdust}. These observations open the field for many detailed studies.
While PLANCK satellite provide polarization information on large scales ($> 5'$ or $> 0.2$ pc in the nearest clouds) between 0.85 mm and 3 mm, only higher resolution instrument such as {\it NIKA} can probe the critical $\sim 0.01 - 0.05 $ pc scales ($\sim$ 10"-60" in the nearest clouds) at which magnetic field lines may channel the matter of interstellar filaments into growing dense cores.

Since the role of the magnetic fields in regulating grain alignment and filamentary structures observed within molecular clouds remains not well understood \citep{Fiege2000}; polarization high angular resolution observations provided by {\it NIKA} polarimeter and the following {\it NIKA2} instrument could be probe this role. 
%One of the challenges of the modern millimeter and sub-millimeter astronomy is to observe Galactic regions in polarimetry in order to investigate this role.
%Since the degree of dust continuum polarized emission is low (typically ~ 5$\%$ - \citep{Matthews2002}), a systematic polarimetric study of nearby star-forming filaments and pre-stellar cores requires a fast mapping speed, a high resolution and a large FoV (Field of View) foreseen in {\it NIKA} prototype and improved in the final instrument {\it NIKA}2.

The {\it NIKA} camera installed until February 2015 at the IRAM 30 m telescope in the Sierra Nevada (Spain) and replaced by {\it NIKA}2 on October 2015 has demonstrated its competitiveness in total power observations \citep{catalano2014, adam2014, adam2015}.
The observation of the dust emission of Galactic regions is the purpose of the {\it NIKA} polarimeter, consisting of a warm system (300K) composed by a multi-layer Half Wave Plate (HWP) and a polarizer, placed in front of the cryostat window. 

The fast rotating HWP ($\sim$ 3 Hz ) combined to the small time constant of the Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) ($ < $ 1 ms) allows to shift the polarized signal at four times the HWP mechanical rotation frequency $\omega$ far from the 1/f noise component. This detection strategy permits the quasi simultaneous measurement of the three Stokes parameters, $I$, $Q$, $U$ on a same area of the Sky \citep{johnson2007}. 

This paper aims to discuss the performance of the polarization system chosen. It
is organized as follows, section \ref{nika instrument} presents the instrument
and the polarization facilities; section \ref{lab characterization} presents the
results from the instrumental characterization in laboratory; section
\ref{observation strategy} presents the characterization of the instrument at
the telescope; section \ref{sec:pipeline} presents the polarization pipeline
data reduction software; section \ref{calibration} the results of the
photometric calibration and section \ref{polcalib} the polarized calibration
provided on several quasars; section \ref{extended results} presents the
polarization maps on few extended sources, Orion OMC-1, M87 and CygnusA.

%The polarization of electromagnetic radiation is an essential piece of information to determine the nature of emission pro-cesses and the physical parameters of the environment in which the radiation is generated. 
	 %Current observations of galactic magnetic fields have shown that their presence has played a major part in the evolution of these galaxies and the formation of their large-scale structure.  While magnetic fields reduce the star formation rate by stabilizing the gas clouds, it also aids in the formation of young stars by reducing the angular momentum of the protostellar clouds.

\section{The \nika~ Instrument}
\label{nika instrument}

An extended description of \nika~ and its performaces can be found
in {\color{red} references to previous papers}, we here give only a brief
summary of the instrument and focus on the extra module that was added to
provide \nika~with polarimetric capabilities.

\subsection{\nika: a dual band LEKID camera}
 \nika~ is a dual band camera
\citep{monfardini2010} consisting of two arrays filled by Lumped Element Kinetic
Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs) with a Hilbert geometry \citep{roesch}. LEKIDs are
superconducting resonators. When photons are absorbed, they break Cooper pairs
in the superconducting resonant element. This changes the density of
quasi-particles and modifies the kinetic inductance, and hence the resonant
frequency of the LEKID \citep{Doyle2008}. The absorbed power can be directly
related to the shift of the resonant frequency. {\color{Red} add reference to
  the NIKA paper where we derive RF\_dIdQ}. The two LEKID arrays are cooled down
to their optimal temperature of $\sim$ 100~mK by a 4K cryocooler and a
closed-cycle $^3$He - $^4$He dilution. The optical coupling between the
telescope and the detectors is achieved by warm aluminum mirrors and cold
refractive optics \citep{catalano2014}. The camera observes the sky in two
millimeter channels, at 1.25 mm and 2.05 mm corresponding to the bandwidth of
100 - 300 GHz {\color{red} give exact bandwidths} with central frequencies of
260 GHz and 150 GHz, respectively. It has a Field of View (FoV) of $\sim$ 1.8
arcminutes and angular resolutions (FWHM) of 18.5 arcsec and 12.5 arcsec at 150
GHz and 260 GHz, respectively.
 	%The classical design \citep{monfardini2011} was sensitive to the polarization, therefore the efficiency of the imaging experiment was reduced. So it has been chosen a new design, the LEKID Hilbert geometry \citep{roesch} that make the pixels sensitive to both orientations of the linear polarization.

\end{figure}

%% . Both of them are in front of the cryostat entrance
%%   window at 300K, as schematically illustrated in
%%   Fig. \ref{fig:setup_polar}.

Our LEKIDS absorb the incoming radiation after it has passed through an
analyser. In this context, letting aside calibration and system imperfections at
this stage, they measure a combination of the three Stokes parameters $m = I +
Q\cos2\psi + U\sin2\psi$, where $\psi$ is the angle between the analyser and the
$x$ axis of the polarization definition frame. Experiments such as Planck
{\color{red}(ref)}, BICEP {\color{red}(ref)}, QUaD {\color{red}(ref)}... rotate
the instrument w.r.t. the sky to vary $\psi$ and derive $I$, $Q$ and
$U$. Experiments such as PILOT {\color{red}(ref)}, {\color{red}(Another one ?)}
use a HWP before an analyser to rotate $Q$ and $U$ while maintaining the payload
attitude and so $\psi$ fixed. While this/these project/s {\color{red}(TBC)}
maintain/s the HWP fixed observations and rotate it only between scans, in NIKA,
like in EBEX {\color{red}(ref)}, we rotate it continuously. The
HWP and the analyser are placed in front of the cryostat window as shown on
Fig.~\ref{cabin}. Our two bands are therefore sensitive to polarization.

%In order to take in account the optical requirements at the telescope, the
%polarizer is mounted at a distance of 6 $cm$ from the HWP with its substrate
%plane at 10 degrees with the optical axis to avoid standing waves with the cold
%optical filters inside the cryostat.

The HWP consists in a stack of several layers of {\color{red} what material
  exactly etc...} built by \cite{savini2006} {\color{red} check who actually
  designed, manufactured it and where !}. This concept is especially designed to
allow approximately constant phase shifts of the transmitted radiation overt
broad spectral bands. A two-layer broadband anti-reflection coating has been
added to maximise the in-band transmission of the HWP and it has been also
hot-pressed on the front and back surfaces of the assembled plate. \nika~LEKIDs
are sensitive to both polarizations and the polarizer placed behind the HWP
plays the role of an analyser. It is rotated at constant pace by a stepper motor
({\color{red} give a bit more details on this rotator...}

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] the ``cryostat'' used in these lab tests actually was \nika, right
  ? let's mention it then and rephrase the sentence.
\item[-] need to add a word on what was done in Cardiff and
  why we do or do not report on this here.
\item[-] Need to justify what previous experience allows us to assume that the
  polarizer is perfect.
\item[-] I don't understand why we talk about distortion of the bandpass with
  the HWP rotation ? Do you mean ``attenuation'' instead ?
\item[-] {\bf We need to explicit an equation to explain why it's a 45 deg
  rotation that separates max and min transmissions}
\item[-] I've removed the mention to the ``linear shift'' between the two bands
  because it's not shown on any plot and not dicussed. If we do have sthg to say
  about this, we should develop more. We should definitely say and show that the
  HWP is achromatic.
\end{itemize}
}

In order to estimate the performances of the whole polarization chain and the
contribution from potential instrumental polarization induced by the HWP and the
polarizer, we performed measurements of the system efficiency in laboratory. To
characterize the spectral transmission of the system we used a polarizing Martin
Puplett type Fourier Transform Spectrometer (MPFTS). The HWP was held in fixed
position during measurements, but its orientation was controlled by the
mechanical modulator. It has 100 steps per 360 degrees, thus giving a $\pm
1.8^{\circ}$ uncertainty on the HWP absolute orientation. The LEKIDs were placed
in a dilution cryostat {\color{red} (\nika?)} that cools down the optics and the
LEKIDs to 100 mK, (see Fig.~\ref{fig:setup_lab}). The MPFTS produces the
difference between the power of two input polarised beams that come from two
black bodies at different temperatures (ambient eccosorb and warmed eccosorb)
modulated by a rotating wire-grid polarizer. As far as the polarization module
is concerned, we assume an ideal polarizer {\color{red} say briefly why} and we
focus only on the characterization of the HWP parameters.

The output of the MPFTS is linearly polarized. Rotating the HWP angle rotates
this polarization with respect to the analyser and induces an attenuation of the
signal measured by the LEKIDs, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spectre}. When the HWP
aligns the polarization with the analyser, we have maximum transmission ($46.8
\pm 1.8^{\circ}$), when it aligns it in the orthogonal direction, we have
minimum transmission ($86.4\pm1.8^\circ$). The nearly $45^\circ$ difference
between these two HWP positions agrees with
Eq.~(\ref{eq:hwp_and_polarizer}). Note that we cannot expect zero transmission
because of the wide band of the instrument ({\color{red} Please confirm this of
  give explanations why we do not measure strictly 45 deg within error bars
  :)}. Our goal is to use these measurements to determine the parameters of the
HWP as given by Eq.~(\ref{equ.hwp}). $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the transmission
coefficients of the orthogonal polarizations aligned with the birefringent
axes. $\theta$ is the angle of the incident polarization with respect to the
reference frame defined by these axes and {$\phi$} is the phase shift introduced
by the plate between the two orthogonal polarizations. {\color{red} $\phi =
  ???$} has been measured in Cardiff when the HWP was manufactured. The absolute
values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is degenerate with the absolute calibration
{\color{red} double check this}, so we fix $\alpha$ and only fit the relative
value of $\beta$. We find $\beta = 0.994\pm0.005$ at 1.25 mm and $\beta =
0.924\pm0.005$ at 2.05 mm. The polarization efficiency as defined by
{\color{red} write the definition equation of rho pol} Eq.~(\ref{eq:rho_pol}) is
thus $\rho_{\rm pol} = 0.994 \pm 0.01$ at 1.25 mm and $0.986 \pm 0.01$ at 2.05
mm. These values are accounted for in the final absolute calibration of our
polarization maps. Last, differences between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ modulate the
incoming polarization around the second harmonic of the HWP rotation, but as
presented in Sect.~\ref{se:demod_mapmaking}, we are not sensitive to this.

%% of the for each wavelength due to the linear relation
%% between the phase shift and the wavelength. This effect is expected to be quite
%% weak because the HWP is achromatic \citep{moncelsi2014}. First we measured a
%% spectrum with the HWP aligned to its ordinary axis. This corresponds to the
%% maximum signal in which we expect to have no distortion {\color{red} see
%%   comment} of the {\it NIKA}
%% bandpass, as measured in intensity \citep{catalano2014}. This is taken as a
%% reference spectrum. Rotating the HWP we found an attenuation as shown in
%% fig. \ref{fig:spectre}, here the maximum transmission is represented by the
%% spectrum at about 46.8$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 1.8$^{\circ}$ with respect to the HWP
%% zero.

% The polarized transmission is therefore of $\sim$ 100\% in the {\it NIKA} band
% frequency with a polarized transmission loss of 0.6 $\%$ in the 1mm channel and
% of 1.4$\%$ in the 2mm channel.
 
%In the 1mm channel the polarization loss is very low so we consider to work with
%an ideal HWP assuming the $\rho_{pol}$ = 1 in the following data reduction
%analysis. In the 2mm channel we take into account for the coefficient
%$\rho_{pol}$ in the calibration factor.

%\section{Observation strategy for polarization measurements}
\section{Data analysis and derivation of Stokes parameters maps}
\label{data_analysis}

We here describe the specificities of \nika's polarization modulation strategy
and data analysis. We start by giving more details on the fast and continuous
rotation of the HWP and how it impacts the signal. We then present specific
systematics associated to the rotating HWP and the optics and how we cope with
them. We postpone the determination of the absolute polarization angle on the
sky and of the absolute calibraiton to the following section.

\subsection{Timelines demodulation and map making}
\label{se:demod_mapmaking}

%In order to extract the polarized signal from the unpolarized foreground we use
%the modulation/demodulation technique: by means of a polarization modulator, the
%HWP in our case, the polarized component of the incoming radiation is modulated
%at a precise frequency.
%A total power detector such as a LEKID or a bolometer, hit by a
%  polarized light, measures a combination of the three Stokes parameters. The
%  relative weights of the Stokes parameters are then a function of the
%  orientation of the incoming polarization and at least three different
%  orientations are needed to separate $I$, $Q$ and $U$ in principle. The
%  rotation of the HWP in front of the analyser provides this rotation following
%  Eq.~(\ref{signal_polar}).

The HWP rotation speed is constrained by several factors. Usual scanning speeds
of the order of one arcmin/s or less, combine with atmospheric variations into a
$1/f$ like noise with knee frequency below 1~Hz. Electronics noise becomes
subdominant above 1~Hz as well {\color{red} exact value TBC}. Rotating the HWP
such that 4 times its rotation speed places the polarization signal well above
1~Hz allows a natural rejection of these two types of noise. If the rotation is
also fast compared to the scanning speed and the angular resolution, all the
Stokes parameters can be derived quasi-simultaneously, thus rejecting further
residual low frequency drifts. Last, a fast rotation places parasitic signals at
harmonics of the rotation frequency outside the signal band (see
sect.~\ref{se:hwpss} for more details). On the other hand, a fast rotation
sets tighter mechanical constraints on the stepper motor and impose a faster
data acquisition. Accounting for all this, we chose to acquire data at 47.7~Hz,
rotate the HWP at 2.98~Hz and limit our scanning speed to 26~arcsec/s. This
provides 5 measures of $I$, $Q$ and $U$ per FWHM, well within the Nyquist limit,
even at a LEKID timeline level.

To project maps of the three Stokes parameters, we use a lockin procedure
pionneered by Maxipol \citep{johnson2007}. This lockin consists in multiplying
the data TOI by the cosine (resp.~sine) of four times the HWP angle and then
lowpass with a high frequency larger than the beam cutoff to build a pure $Q$
(resp.~$U$) timeline {\color{red} it would be nice to have this beam cutoff shown
  on a plot}. This is performed on all KIDs and these $Q$ or $U$
timelines can then be coadded onto maps with inverse noise weighting which is
almost equivalent to optimal map making given that the noise is very close to
being white in our polarization timelines (see Fig.~\ref{fig:spectre_iqu})
{\color{red} Recheck this plot and its caption}.

\subsection{HWP Synchronous Signal}

    \label{time_drift}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
  
Imperfections of the HWP modulate the background and lead to a strong
additionnal signal on the timelines, highly peaked at harmonics of the HWP
rotation frequency $\nu_P$ as shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:spectre_iqu}. Such a HWP
Synchronous Signal (HWPSS) has already been observed by Maxima
\citep{johnson2007} and EBEX \citep{ebex}. Like them, we observe that the signal
is well fitted by a sum of harmonics of $\nu_P$, with amplitudes slowly and
linearly drifting with time at the level of {\color{red}XXX\%/s}
(Fig.~\ref{time_drift}). We therefore explicitely model this additionnal signal
as

\begin{eqnarray}
HWPSS(t) &= \sum_{n=1}^{8}& (A_n+ \epsilon_{A_n}t)\cos n2\pi\nu_Pt\nonumber\\
&& +(B_n+\epsilon_{B_n}t)\sin n2\pi\nu_Pt.
\label{eq:hwpss}
\end{eqnarray}

We collect all samples of a kid into a vector ${\bf v}$, build a matrix $T$
whose columns are $\cos n2\pi\nu_Pt$, $t\cos n2\pi\nu_Pt$, $\sin n2\pi\nu_Pt$
and $t\sin n2\pi\nu_Pt$. We then perform a maximum likelihood fit giving the
same weight to all samples ${\bf a} =
(T^TT)^{-1}T^T{\bf v}$ to derive ${\bf a}$, a vector containing amplitudes $A_n$,
$B_n$ and $\epsilon_{A_n}$ and $\epsilon_{B_n}$. With this amplitudes in hand,
we can build a model of the HWPSS in the kid timeline and subtract it.

We could in principle improve this fit by using only samples far from the source
when possible. However, the HWPSS is about {\color{red}XXX~Jy} peak to peak,
therefore much stronger than the astronomical signals we observe, and not sky
synchronous. We thus found that it did not make any difference to take this
extra precaution, and as far as this technical run is concerned, we did not
apply this masking. {\color{red} we need to conclude this section by a plot
  showing how well this model subtracts the ``true'' HWPSS. We must also repeat
  that we actually care only about effects around $4\nu_P$}\\

We can then summarize our map making algorith as follows. Let's denote by
$\delta$ the elevation of the considered kid and $\eta$ the parallactic angle:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fit and subtract the HWPSS from each kid
\item Make two extra copies of the obtained TOI's. Multiply one of them by
  $\cos[4\omega+2(\delta-\eta)]$ and lowpass at 2.9~Hz to obtain a
  $Q$-timeline. Multiply the other one by $\sin[4\omega+2(\delta-\eta)]$,
lowpass at 2.9~Hz to obtain a $U$-timeline. Simply lowpass the original one
  at 2.9~Hz to have the $I$-timeline.
\item Coadd with inverse noise weighting these timelines onto three separate
  maps of $I$, $Q$ and $U$.
\end{enumerate}

%% {\color{green} to be rephrased and placed somewhere else: As we have discussed
%%   above the power spectrum of the TOIP is consisting with a flat spectrum. The
%%   negative and positive beam observed in the leakage maps compensate each other
%%   and smooth the effect.  Taking a convolution between the atmospherical spread
%%   signal, the Stokes intensity $I$ map with the characteristic 1/f component of
%%   noise, and the leakage beam in $Q$ and $U$ we found that the two component
%%   compensation drowning the effect in a white noise.}

In order to estimate the level of the instrumental polarization at the telescope
we repeatedly observed Uranus, that is unpolarized, bright (47.2~Jy at 1mm,
16.4~Jy at 2mm) and small ({\color{Red}XXX arcsec diameter}) compared to our
beams. Not only do we find non zero polarization, but the shapes of $Q_{Uranus}$
and $U_{uranus}$ also differ from that of total power beam
(Fig.~\ref{fig:uranus_lkg}). Indeed, we observe a mainly dipolar pattern,
partially consistent between the two bands, with a peak to peak amplitude at the
level of 3\% of the total intensity peak. Such an effect has already been
observed on previous experiments, e.~g.~BICEP ({\color{red}ref TBC}), QUaD
({\color{red}ref TBC}), PILOT ({\color{red}ref TBC, etc...}). Monitoring of this
effect at different elevation angle shows that it is fixed in Nasmyth
(i.e.~cabin) coordinates. Note that this effect does not lead to a direct
scaling of the sky noise into polarization at the 3\% level because in this
case of diffuse emission, the integral of the term and not only the peak value
must be considered. At best, it therefore creates a contamination at the
{\color{red} XXX exact level TBC and complement this sentence with a remark on
  the possibility to decorrelate Q and U timelines like I.}

So far, we still lack a convincing physical interpretation. However, formally,
it can be considered as leakage from total power $I$ into $Q$ and $U$. To
mitigate this effect, we have developped the following algorithm. We denote
quantities unaffected by any beam with a $_0$ index and with a $^N$ superscript,
quantities evaluated in Nasmyth coordinates. Like in Sect.~\ref{se:pol_module},
$\psi$ is the polarization observation angle that accounts for both the HWP
angle and the parallactic angle. Leaving noise aside for the sake of
readability, we model the noise less measurement of a kid $k$ at time $t$ such
as the sum of the signal convolved by the instrumental main beam $B_I$ and of an
extra leakage term from the signal intensity into $Q$ and $U$:

\begin{eqnarray}
S_k &=& B_I * (I^N_0 + Q^N_0\cos2\psi + U^N_0\sin2\psi) \nonumber \\
       &&+ L_{IQ}*I^N_0\cos2\psi + L_{IU}*I^N_0\sin2\psi,
\label{eq_leak}
\end{eqnarray}

where $*$ denotes convolution. As Uranus can be considered as a point source
with respect to the \nika's angular resolution, the $Q^N$ and $U^N$ maps give
directly the $L_{ IQ}$ and $L_{ IU}$ beams, up to an absolute calibration factor
that is straightforward to scale by comparing to the $I$ map. All that is needed
now to subtract the leakage terms from the measurements is an estimate of
$I^N_0$. While we cannot deconvolve the observed $I$ map from the instrumental
beam $B_I$ with perfect accuracy, this is actually not needed since $I^N_0$ must
be convolved back by $L_{IQ}$ and $L_{IU}$. This sets a scale in Fourier space
up to which division by the instrumental beam $B_I$ remains accurate enough
compared to knowledge on $B_I$ and on map noise, and above which multiplication
by the leakage beams ensures a regularizing damping. We thus summarize our
correction process as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item With the demodulation and projection techniques presented in
  Sect.~\ref{data_analysis}, build maps of $I$, $Q$ and $U$ of the observed
  signal in equatorial coordinates. This map can be the result of multiple scans to have
  the best possible signal to noise.
% This map can be the combination of multiple scans to
%  have the best signal to noise S/N.
\item Rotate this map in Nasmyth coordinates to obtain $I_N$, $Q_N$ and $U_N$
  for the current scan.
\item Build the convolution/deconvolution kernels $L_{IQ}/B_I$ and $L_{IU}/B_I$
  in Fourier space from observations of Uranus.
\item Multiply the Fourier transform of $I^N$ by these kernels in Fourier space
  and transform the result back into real space to have maps of leakages from
  $I$ into $Q$ and $U$.
\item Deproject the obtained maps with the actual scan pattern to produce
  timelines that are then subtracted from the data TOIs.
\item Project these corrected TOIs onto final maps.
\end{enumerate}

The rotation from equatorial to Nasmyth coordinates introduces a small
error. Indeed, the rotation angle combines the elevation and the parallactic
angles that are not constant during the scan. Ideally, we should rotate the
equatorial map continuously in time. Although doable in principle, at the
expense of computation speed, this only an uncertainty on the error and is thus
of second order.


%% The deconvolution/convolution steps 3 and 4 are performed at the same time in Fourier
%% space:
%% 
%% \begin{equation}
%% (I^N_0*L_{IQ})(k) = I^N_0(k) \times L_{IQ}(k) \simeq I^N(k)/B_I(k)\times L_{IQ}(k)

%% The ratio $L_{IQ}(k)/B_I(k)$ is tapered so that the division by decreasing terms
%% of $B_I(k)$ when $k$ increases is counterbalanced by the deaming of

this correction applies on Uranus maps. The residual instrumental polarization

presented in Sec.~\ref{se:calib}.

{\color{green} quasars: know and stable, variable but observed at the same time. End up by
mentioning the remaining discrepencies and likely explanations and why we remain
confident, in particular with the addtional observations of the Crab and OMC1}

In this section, we describe how we calibrate \nika~in polarization mode.

The absolute calibration follows the exact same method as in total power and is
described extensively in \cite{catalano2014} {\color{red} check ref}. Uranus is
our main absolute flux calibrator. We correct for sky opacity using {\it
  skydips}, i.e.~pure elevation scans that help us monitor the response of the
LEKIDs to air mass and hence correct for it. For this polarized technical run,
we have 15\% uncertainty on absolute calibration at 1.25~mm and 10\% at
2.05~mm. Our measured FWHM's are 13.5~arcsec at 1.25~mm and 18.4~arcsec at 2.05~mm.

The calibration of \nika's orientation on the other hand, is specific to this
work. During that period of February 2015, we could observer...

%% In real conditions there is an additional parasitic signal at harmonics of 1{$\omega$}, 2{$\omega$}, 3{$\omega$} etc, due to imperfections of the HWP. Furthermore, the atmospheric and electronic noise need to be taken into account.

%% \begin{eqnarray}
%%  m_{k} &=& \frac{1}{2}\{I + {\rho}_{ pol}[Q\cos(4{\omega}t + 2{\alpha}_{\rm Sky}(p_{\rm t})) + Usin({4{\omega}t} \nonumber \\

%%  \section{Data analysis}\label{sec:pipeline}
%% In order to calibrate, filter, and project data onto sky maps we developed a
%% dedicated reduction pipeline based on the intensity one described in
%% \citep{catalano2014, adam2014}. The main steps of the processing consist of:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item read data time ordered information (TOI): data ordered per kid and regularly sampled with time.
%% \item TOI calibration: the absolute calibration is applied to these TOIs and an
%%   atmospheric absorption correction performed. The planet Uranus is the primary
%%   calibrator for the {\it NIKA} absolute calibration. The calibration factor is
%%   derived by fitting a Gaussian of fixed angular size on the reconstructed maps
%%   of Uranus \citep{catalano2014}. The sky maps are corrected for the atmospheric
%%   contribution rescaling the observed signal by what that would be obtained in
%%   the absence of the atmosphere. This is achieved via the elevation scan
%%   technique (\emph{skydip}).
%% 
%% The {\it NIKA} atmospheric calibration consist in measuring the variation in the
%% resonance frequencies of the detectors versus the airmass via elevation scans
%% (\emph{skydip} \citep{dicke}) from 65 to 20 degrees above the horizon. This
%% procedure permits to use {\it NIKA} instrument itself as a tau-meter
%% \citep{catalano2014}.
%% \item atmospheric and electronic noise decorrelation: depending on the
%%   scientific target, two basic decorrelation methods are used, 1) a dual-band
%%   decorrelation using a specific channel to obtain a template of the atmospheric
%%   emission and 2) a single-band decorrelation where a sky noise TOI template is
%%   produced by averaging all TOIs of a single array. In both cases we mask the
%%   astrophysical source to select the pixels far from the source to reconstruct
%%   the subtraction template (common mode).
%% \item map-making: TOIs from different detectors of a same frequency band are projected into a single map using a simple coalition.

%%In order to analyse the polarized data output we have developed a dedicated
%%polarization data reduction pipeline. $I$, $Q$, $U$ Stokes parameters maps in
%%sky coordinates are constructed by applying the following steps
%%
%%\subsubsection{Construct the template of the HWP modulation and removal of parasitic signal.} 
%%
%%
%%%Given a linear polarizing grid aligned with the +$Q$ state and a constant input polarization state, 
%%As discussed above the polarized power transmitted varies as a sinusoid with
%%angular frequency 4$\omega$, with amplitude $\propto$ $\sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}$ and
%%phase $\phi$ $\propto$ $arctan(U/Q)$.
%%
%%To have the polarized signal we extract this 4$\omega$ sinusoid component from
%%the signal recorded by a detector and reconstruct the incident $Q$ and $U$
%%states for making maps.
%%
%%Unfortunately the rotation of the HWP does not simply modulate optical
%%polarization signals into the detector timestream as sidelobes of
%%4$\omega$. Defects in the HWP or non-uniformities in its motion can be expected
%%to generate signals in the detector timestreams at arbitrary harmonics of its
%%rotation frequency.
%%
%%They are stationary in time, and thus appear as spikes in a signal period, which
%%can be completely described in terms of harmonic number, phase, and
%%amplitude. The periodic signal that is the combination of these harmonic terms
%%is called the HWP template.
%% 
%%%We fit this signal before proceeding with further analysis. 
%%Thanks to the synchronization of the detector KID with the acquisition software we can reconstruct the HWP rotation angle and we model the HWP-synchronous signal (HWPSS) \citep{johnson2007} as:
%%
%%\begin{eqnarray}
%% <h_{i}> &=& \sum\limits_{i=1}^N A_i cos(i\omega_{i}) + B_i sin(i\omega) \nonumber \\
%% 	     &+& A_{i}^{'} t cos(i\omega_{i}) + B_{i}^{'} t sin(i\omega_{i})
%% \label{hwpss}
%% \end{eqnarray}
%% A, B, A$^{'}$, B$^{'}$ represent the amplitudes of N = 9 harmonics considered. We call this estimator $<h_i>$ the HWP template. 
 
%% To probe the stationarity of the harmonics with time we plot in
%% Fig. \ref{time_drift} the ratio between the linear fit coefficients estimated on
%% the amplitudes variations with time and the HWP template amplitudes fitted $A$,
%% $B$ reconstructed by the Eq. \ref{hwpss}. This figure show the percentage HWP
%% template harmonics variation of $\sim$ 10$^{-3}$. The weak drift in time permits
%% to assume constant the content of this parasitic signal; the data are cleaned by
%% the subtraction of the template reconstructed.

We also observe a harmonics total power content correlated to the opacity
variation at 1mm channel, which is more affected by the atmospherical background
variation. This correlation is shown in
Fig. \ref{ampl_opac_1mm}. Fig. \ref{ampl_opac_2mm} shows the harmonics total
power content for the 2mm channel observations.

%% It is built to include terms linear in time to allow for the template amplitude
%% to drift in time which fit quite well the observed drift; the variations in the
%% HWP rotation frequency are naturally considered because the sinusoidal terms are
%% functions of the HWP orientation angle, not of time.
%% 
%% The procedure used in the data reduction software returns the HWP template
%% fitted in order to subtract it from the measured signal $m_k$, see
%% Eq. \ref{signal_polar}.
%% 
%% Fig. \ref{toi_i} (left) shows a timeline for a KID of Orion OMC-1 observation
%% scan, the raw data (black) are atmospheric turbulence affected with a modulated
%% parasitic synchronous signal at all harmonics of the mechanical rotational
%% frequency $\omega$, the blue line represents the raw data subtracted for the
%% synchronous signal template HWPSS.
%% 
%% A chunk of the timeline in Fig. \ref{toi_i} (left) is shown in Fig. \ref{toi_i}
%% (right) where the modulation is clear at several harmonics of the HWP rotational
%% frequency $\omega$. The linear spectrum on the middle show very well the
%% amplitudes of the harmonics 1$\omega$, 2$\omega$, 3$\omega$ and 4$\omega$ where
%% it is also located the polarized signal.

%\subsubsection{Construction of $Q$ and $U$ TOIs.}

%% \subsubsection{Time-ordered polarization informations (TOIPs) extrapolation.} 
%% To build the timelines TOIP (time-ordered polarization information) we use the
%% modulation/demodulation technique \citep{siringo2003}.  The modulation is given
%% by the rotating HWP and the $Q$ and $U$ timelines are extracted from the TOI by
%% demodulation using a phase-locked at the frequency of 4$\omega$ $\sim$ 12 Hz.

%% \subsubsection{Atmospheric noise and projection of the I, Q, U TOIs into I, Q, U maps}
%% Atmospheric emission dominates at low frequencies with a $1/f$ like spectrum but
%% the modulation of the polarized signal imposed by the HWP combined with the
%% scanning strategy allows us to shift the astrophysical signal away from the
%% largest atmospheric contribution \citep{johnson2007}.
%% 
%% Fig. \ref{spectre_iqu} evidences the importance of the rotational detection
%% mode. Spectra of the three timelines TOI $I$ (left), TOI $Q$ (middle) and TOI
%% $U$ (right) are shown.

The TOI $I$ spectrum shows a $1/f^\beta$ noise with $\beta$ $\sim$ -1.2 due to
the atmospherical fluctuations, the amplitude is time dependant. This noise
component affects all detectors and it is easily subtracted using the common
mode decorrelation.  On the middle and right of the Fig. \ref{spectre_iqu} are
shown the power spectra for TOIP $Q$ and $U$. The spectra are flats showing a
typical white noise spectrum $ < 1 Jy/\sqrt{Hz}$. The Q, U timelines could be
directly projected on maps. This shows the accuracy of this detection strategy.

%%For map making, the demodulation procedure also includes a band-pass filter with
%%high and low-pass edges at 0.01 and 2.9 Hz, respectively, that is used to reject
%%any out-of-band signals. In order to make a $n_{pix}$ map, all samples must be
%%taken into account to include noise correlations (in time and from pixel to
%%pixel) \citep{benoit2004}. Equation \ref{signal_polar} is generalized to:
%%
%%\begin{equation}
%%\mathbf{M} = \mathcfal{A} \mathbf{S} + \mathbf{N} 
%% \end{equation}

%% where $\mathbf{M}$ is the time ordered vector of $n_{\rm t}$ x $n_{\rm kid}$
%% measures, $\mathbf{S}$ the (3 $n_{\rm pix}$) - vector Stokes map of the sky,

%Nevertheless the time ordered data contain a significant instrumental signal which is synchronous with the rotation of the HWP, as shown in fig. \ref{toi_i}. The HWP synchronous signal is estimated and subtracted from the raw data, producing the time-ordered information (TOI). 


%When the noise is not correlated from one measurement to another,  $\mathcal{N}$ is diagonal and the inversion of large matrices can be solved. We therefore consider each pixel individually, computing the (3,3)- matrix  $\mathcal{A}^{T} \mathcal{N}^{-1} \mathcal{A}$ and the (3)-vector $\mathcal{A}^{T} \mathcal{N}^{-1} \mathbf{M}$.
  
%%\subsection{Intensity to polarization leakage}
%%In order to estimate the level of the instrumental polarization at the telescope
%%we have observed the planet, Uranus, which is expected to be unpolarized.  From
%%the $I, Q, U$ maps of Uranus, see Fig. \ref{uranus} we identify a systematic
%%effect fixed in NASMYTH coordinates which the cabin reference frame.

  \label{Uranus_corrected}
  \end{center}
  \end{figure*}

%% To first order we assume this effect as a leakage of total power into
%% polarization. In terms of instrumental polarization degree the systematic effect
%% at the peak of the leakage beam maps corresponds to 2 $\%$ and 3 $\%$ of the
%% intensity $I$ at 150 and 260 GHz, respectively.
%% 
%% As we have discussed above the power spectrum of the TOIP is consisting with a
%% flat spectrum. The negative and positive beam observed in the leakage maps
%% compensate each other and smooth the effect.  Taking a convolution between the
%% atmospherical spread signal, the Stokes intensity $I$ map with the
%% characteristic 1/f component of noise, and the leakage beam in $Q$ and $U$ we
%% found that the two component compensation drowning the effect in a white noise.
%%  
%% We have developed an algorithm to take into account for the effect on maps and
%% any additional instrumental polarization signal.  Let's call S$_k$ the
%% instantaneous measure of a kid and denote by a superscript $^N$ the Nasmyth
%% coordinates, we have:
%% 
%% \begin{eqnarray}
%% S_k &=& B_I * (I^N_0 + Q^N_0\cos2\alpha_{\rm Sky} + U^N_0\sin2\alpha_{\rm Sky}) \nonumber \\
%%        &+& L_{IQ}*I^N_0\cos2\alpha_{\rm Sky} + L_{IU} * I^N_0\sin2\alpha_{\rm Sky} + {\rm noise}
%% \label{eq_leak}
%% \end{eqnarray}
%% where $\alpha_{\rm Sky}$ accounts for the HWP angle and sky coordinates rotation and $B$ denotes
%% the instrumental beam. $L_{IX}$ the effective beam of the leakage. As Uranus can be considered a point source with respect to the {\it NIKA} FWHM, the $Q^N$ and $U^N$ maps give directly the $L^{\rm IQ}$ and $L^{\rm IU}$ beams. 
%% The algorithm used for the polarization leakage effect is:
%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item Build a map of $I$, $Q$ and $U$ of the observed source in R.A. and
%%   Dec. This map can be the combination of multiple scans to have the best signal
%%   to noise S/N.
%% \item Rotate this map in Nasmyth coordinates to obtain $I_N$, $Q_N$ and $U_N$.
%% \item Deconvolve $I_N$ from the instrumental beam to have an estimate of
%%   $\hat{I}_0$ of the unprojected intensity.
%% \item Convolve $\hat{I}_0$ with the Uranus $Q^N$ and $U^N$ maps to obtain an estimation of the polarization leakage signal. 
%% \item Deproject these maps to produce timelines and subtract these timelines from the
%%   original data.
%% \item Project these corrected data onto final Stokes parameters maps.
%% \end{enumerate}
%% 
%% The deconvolution/convolution steps 3 and 4 are performed at the same time in Fourier
%% space:
%% 
%% \begin{equation}
%% (I^N_0*L_{IQ})(k) = I^N_0(k) \times L_{IQ}(k) \simeq I^N(k)/B_I(k)\times L_{IQ}(k)
%% \end{equation}
%% The ratio $L_{IQ}(k)/B_I(k)$ is tapered so that the division by decreasing terms
%% of $B_I(k)$ when $k$ increases is counterbalanced by the deaming of
%% $L_{IQ}(k)$. Once this correction is applied on Uranus polarization maps the instrumental residual polarisation is estimated to be below 0.1 $\%$ as shown in Fig. \ref{Uranus_corrected}. $I, Q, U$ maps are shown in order to compare directly with the maps uncorrected represented in Fig. \ref{uranus}.
%% 
%% In order to show the effect of the algorithm leakage correction we show the maps obtained at 150 GHz of the quasar 3C 273  shown in Fig. \ref{3c273_ex}, projected in RA, Dec coordinates. The maps show the systematic effect in the polarized maps $Q$ and $U$ (top) and the efficiency of our algorithm correction in the corrected maps on bottom.

\section{Photometric calibration}\label{calibration}
During the polarization campaign on February the calibration procedure used was
the same discussed in section \ref{sec:pipeline}, the \emph{skydip} has been
performed with the operating rotating HWP and the polarization pipeline has been
used in order to have the TOI intensity Stokes vector $I$.

The calibration factor includes the correction for the reduced flux received by
the LEKIDs due to the warm wire-grid. The calibration uncertainty for point
sources on the final data is estimated to be 15 \% for the 1.25 mm channel and
10 \% for 2.05 mm channel, a list of main error sources is detailed in
\citep{catalano2014}. The FWHM of the beam are 13.5 and 18.4 arcsec at 260 GHz
and 150 GHz.

In order to cross check at the opacity correction and photometric calibration we
compare the results of four quasars (3C 273, 1749+096, 0851+202, 0415+379)
observed by {\it NIKA} and XPOl experiment \citep{thum2008} during a parallel
session of observation during the observational campaign on February 2015. In
the tab. \ref{tab:calib} we can see the consistency of {\it NIKA} results with
XPOl observations. The calibration error, reported in \citep{catalano2014} is of
the order of $\sim$ 10 $\%$ and is taken into account in the statistical
error. The K-correction is $\sim$ 1-2 $\%$ for the synchrotron spectra of
quasars, so it is negligible respect to the calibration error estimation.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Intensity flux results from the parallel session of observations between XPOl and {\it NIKA}.}
\label{tab:calib}
\end{table*}

The Tab. \ref{tab:calib} show the consistency of {\it NIKA} flux measurements with XPOl results at 1mm.

To compare with other experiments we choose two of the quasars collection that we had, 3C 273 and 3C 286. In Fig. \ref{sed_3C286} we show the spectral energy density (SED) for the quasar 3C286, which is considered a primary calibrator for polarization experiments too. 

We plot the results obtained by PLANCK \citep{planckcatalogue}, ALMA \citep{almacalib}, XPOl \citep{xpol} and {\it NIKA} polarization campaign (February 2015).  We observe a synchrotron spectrum with a power law $\propto$ $\nu^{\rm \beta}$ with spectral index  $\beta$ $\simeq$ -1.007 $\pm$ 0.033. The fig. \ref{sed_3C273} presents the PLANCK and NIKA results for the quasar 3C273, the spectrum shows two power laws with spectral index $\beta_1$ $\simeq$ -0.29$\pm$0.05 and $\beta_2$ $\simeq$ -0.85$\pm$0.06. 

These two figures \ref{sed_3C273}, \ref{sed_3C286} shows the good photometric calibration effectuated and consistency of the {\it NIKA} results.

% Instrumental polarization and results ------------------------------------------------------------------------     

\section{Polarimetry calibration}\label{polcalib}
To perform the calibration of the {\it NIKA} polarimeter we observed a selected list of quasars with low variability. Tab. \ref{tab:table_quasar} reporting the flux measured in $I, Q, U$, the polarization degree and angle on all maps of the quasars observed at both {\it NIKA} wavelengths. The results shown in this table are corrected for the leakage effect as discussed above.
The polarization degree $p$ is defined by 

\begin{equation}
p = \sqrt{(Q^2 + U^2)}/I
\end{equation}
with uncertainty:
\begin{equation}
\sigma p = p^{\rm -1} \sqrt{dQ^2Q^2 + dU^2U^2}
\end{equation}
and the polarization angle $\alpha_{\rm Sky}$
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\rm Sky} = \frac{1}{2} \arctan\frac{U}{Q} ,  0 < \alpha_{\rm Sky} < \pi
\end{equation}
with statistical uncertainty:
\begin{equation}
\sigma\alpha_{\rm Sky}^{\rm stat} = \frac{1}{2}\{(Q^2+U^2)\sqrt{Q^2dU^2 + U^2dQ^2}\}^{\rm -1}
\end{equation}
The polarization angle is directly measured on the Sky considering the HWP zero defined with respect to the Nasmyth coordinates reference frame. A synchronized acquisition software provides the rotation angles of the HWP taken into account in the data analysis. As discussed above our precision in the determination of the HWP zero is 1.8$^\circ$, this is considered a systematic error in polarization angle measurements.
In the following sections we discuss the {\it NIKA} results comparing with previous observations. 

\subsection{3C 286}
3C 286 is a compact  steep-spectrum quasar at redshift z = 0.846. At centimeter wavelengths, 3C 286 represents the usual polarization calibrator; its position angle has been stable for decades \citep{perley&butler}. 

XPOl  polarimeter \citep{thum2008} has observed this quasar  at millimeter wavelengths for few years (2006-2012)  \citep{xpol}. The observations show a polarization angle (PA) of 3C 286 increasing slowly with frequency. 

The stability of this quasar in intensity and polarization in a large frequency range and the slow wavelength dependence identify it as a primary calibrator for polarization measurements. 

XPOl found a polarization angle $\alpha_{\rm Sky}$ = [37.3 $\pm$ 0.8]$^\circ$ and  $\alpha_{\rm Sky}$ = [33.1$\pm$5.7]$^\circ$, a polarization degree $p$= [13.5 $\pm$ 0.3] $\%$ and $p$ = [14.4$\pm$1.8] $\%$ at 86 and 229 GHz, respectively \citep{xpol}. Recent observation of 3C286 at 1.3 mm done by CARMA polarimeter \citep{carma} reports a polarization angle $\alpha_{\rm Sky}$ = [39.2$\pm$1]$^\circ$. 

{\it NIKA} polarimeter measures $\alpha_{Sky}$ = [29.0 $\pm$ 3.9]$^\circ$ and $\alpha_{Sky}$ = [27.7 $\pm$ 3.9]$^\circ$, a polarization degree $p$ = [14.1$\pm$3.2] $\%$ and $p$ = [12.9$\pm$2.9] $\%$ at 260 GHz and 150 GHz, respectively.

The agreement of the {\it NIKA} results with other millimeter experiments show the good performance of this new polarimeter in polarized light detection. 

\subsection{3C 279}
The blazar 3C 279 is one of the brightest and monitored flat-spectrum quasar and was the first object to exhibit apparent superluminal motion. The source of its strong radio to $\gamma$-ray emission  is  a  relativistic  jet  of  material  ejected  from  near  the black  hole  in  3C  279 \citep{apex3c279}.  

The {\it NIKA} results in intensity and polarization flux are reported in Tab. \ref{tab:tab_quasar}. For the polarization angles we found $\alpha_{Sky}$ = [35.9 $\pm$ 3.2]$^\circ$ and $\alpha_{Sky}$ = [31.9 $\pm$ 3.6]$^\circ$ and polarization degree $p$ = [9.8 $\pm$ 2.2] $\%$ and $p$ = [9.5 $\pm$ 2.2] $\%$ at 260 and 150 GHz, respectively. 
These results are in agreement with recent observations of the SHARP Polarimeter \citep{sharp3c279} done on March 2014 at 350 $\mu$m and 3.5, 7, 13 mm. Their observations report a polarization degree between 10-12 $\%$  and the polarization angles  between 32$^\circ$-41$^\circ$.


\subsection{Parallel session {\it NIKA} - XPOl}
On February 2015 we performed an observational parallel session with XPOl experiment. In this section we will discuss the results obtained by the data analysis from the two experiments. 
The results of this parallel session of the observations done between {\it NIKA} and XPOl are shown in Tab. \ref{tab:calib_degree}. 

There are some differences and incompatibilities between {\it NIKA} and XPOl data, most of them are likely due to expected trends between the different wavelengths of the instruments. At higher frequencies closer to the base of the jet the magnetic field tends to be more ordered. This can be explain why the polarization degree tends to increase towards higher frequency. 

The polarization angle is mainly affected by Faraday rotation which changes the angle as proportional $\lambda^2$. It is a weak effect at mm wavelengths, but clearly present in the more active AGNs. This affects more the 3 mm than 2 and 1 mm data. 

An other effect must also be expected due to changing optical depth with frequency which allows to see different parts of the jet where the magnetic field (and thus the polarization angle) may be different. 

\subsubsection{3C273 - 0851+202 - 1749+096 - 0415+379}
The quasar 3C 273 is the brightest and hence one of the best monitored AGN. Located at a distance of z = 0.158 \citep{3c273madsen}, at radio to millimeter and at $\gamma$-ray energies, flares from the relativistic jet dominate the variability of 3C 273 \citep{Abdo2010}. 

As Faraday rotation is proportional to $\lambda^2$  \citep{mckee} Faraday rotation measures (RMs) are expected to diminish at high frequencies. The core of the 3C273 shows this trend \citep{Attridge} at 86 GHz and explains the XPOl results. 

{\it NIKA} polarimeter measures {$\alpha_{Sky}$} = (-89.3 $\pm$ 3.2)$^\circ$ and $\alpha_{Sky}$ = (-74.1 $\pm$ 3.9)$^\circ$, $p$ = [3.8$\pm$0.4] $\%$ and $p$=[2.0 $\pm$ 0.5] $\%$ at 260 GHz and 150 GHz, respectively. 

XPOl measures {$\alpha_{Sky}$} = (-76.8 $\pm$ 1.6)$^\circ$  and {$\alpha_{Sky}$} = (-37.8 $\pm$ 0.9)$^\circ$, $p$ = [3.6$\pm$0.2] $\%$ and $p$ = [1.1$\pm$0.0] $\%$ at 229 GHz and 86 GHz, respectively.

This is the strongest source that we observed in parallel with XPOl and there is agreement between two experiments in both polarization degree and angle.

For the quasar 0851+202 there is a clear discrepancy in the angles between instruments for which we do not have an explanation. May be we have to check in the next observations. There is an agreement for both {\it NIKA} wavelengths.

For the quite variable quasar 1749+096 the {\it NIKA} 1 mm polarization degree is higher than XPOl that observes at 229 GHz.

The quasar 0415+379 is the weakest source at 1mm and however quite variable. It is too weak for XPOl measurement, we observe however an agreement between the two mm channel of {\it NIKA}.


% Extended sources section --------------------------------	
	   
\section{Extended sources observations}\label{extended results}
The systematic effect correction discussed in section \ref{sec:pipeline} is also applied to the observations presented in this section on Orion OMC-1, M87 and Cygnus A. 

\subsection{Orion OMC-1}
The core of OMC-1, containing the Becklin-Neugebauer (BN) object and the Kleinmann-Low (KL) nebula, is an ideal region for polarimetric study of the thermal dust emission. In the background molecular cloud, the KL Nebula is the  peak from farinfrared to millimeter wavelengths on the OMC-1 ridge.
%The Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) is the closest region of high-mass star-formation to the Sun, at $\sim$ 450 pc, and has consequently been much studied. 

The most prominent region in maps of the molecular gas is the OMC1 cloud, which contains several luminous star-forming cores \cite{chini1997} and a large number of young stars. 
In Fig. \ref{Orion_scuba} we show the maps of Orion OMC-1 obtained by SCUPOL instrument \citep{scubapol} at 850 $\mu$m. The contours represent the {\it NIKA} map obtained at 1.25 mm. We observe a bit shift between the two maps may be due to some pointing error in the specific observation session. 

If we compare the polarization intensity IPOL in Fig. \ref{Orion_scuba} on right with the polarization intensity  $IPOL$ = $\sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}$ obtained by {\t NIKA} observation in Fig. \ref{Orion_ipol} there is a consistency in the shape of the polarized regions. 
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[%
    width=0.48\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{figures/orion_i_scuba.pdf}

  \caption{ SCUPOL maps of Stokes vector $I$ (left) and the polarized intensity (right) at 850 microns. The contours represent the {\it NIKA} map at 260 GHz, see fig. \ref{Orion}.}
  \label{Orion_scuba}
  \end{center}
  \end{figure}
  
In fig. \ref{Orion} we present the Orion OMC-1 maps of Stokes vectors $I$, $Q$, $U$ observed at both frequencies and corrected for the systematic effect previously discussed. The peak flux of the OMC1 emission in the Orion A molecular cloud is about 45.8 Jy/beam and 14 Jy/beam at 260 GHz and 150 GHz, respectively. 

The polarization angle and degree calculated with the average of the Stokes parameters are $\alpha_{Sky}$ = (21.3 $\pm$ 3.6)$^\circ$ and $p$ = (4.0 $\pm$ 0.8) $\%$  and  $\alpha_{Sky}$ = (22.1 $\pm$ 2.6)$^\circ$ and $p$ = (6.0 $\pm$ 0.9) $\%$ at 150 GHz and 260 GHz, respectively. 

Previous observations \citep{polka_apex} found the polarization angles in this star formation region $\sim$ 30$^\circ$.
The leakage maps found for this source represented in fig. \ref{Orion_leakage} show a reduced leakage effect compared to point source polarization degree. In fig. \ref{orion_vector} we show the Stokes vector $I$ with the vectors indicating the orientation of the polarization angle.

 
\subsection{M87}
M87 (also designated 3C274, NGC 4486, and Virgo A) is a giant
elliptical galaxy \citep{dev76} located near the 
core of Virgo cluster. 
Its nucleus is a radio and X-ray source, and from it emanates an
optical jet. It is estimated to be 16 Mpc from the earth \citep{mou80}. The core and jet can be seen at all wavelength 
from radio to X-rays.

Radio galaxies serve as a probe of their environments, providing means
to study the pressure, density, temperature, and magnetic strength, {\it
etc.} of the extragalactic medium (IGM) or intra-cluster
medium (ICM). 

The galaxy M87 is more studied at lower frequencies than the {\it NIKA} ones in order to study the physics of the filaments, the polarization 
degrees of the filaments are very high near the limit of synchrotron 
emission at this frequencies e.g. \citep{pac70}. At {\it NIKA} frequencies the galaxy appears with its core and the surrounding lobes. 

The M87 maps of Stokes vectors $I$, $Q$, $U$ observed at both frequencies by {\it NIKA} polarimeter instrument are shown in fig. \ref{M87_maps}. The peak flux of the $I$ map is $\sim$ 0.6 Jy/beam $\sim$ 1.5 Jy/beam at 260 GHz and 150 GHz, respectively. The leakage maps found for this source are shown in fig. \ref{M87_leakage}. 

The polarized intensity at 150 GHz shown in Fig. \ref{M87_ipol} suggests a synchrotron emission of the M87 lobes.  The polarized emission at 260 GHz is quite weak. 

 Fig. \ref{m87_vector} show the Stokes vector $I$ with the vectors indicating the orientation of the polarization angle at both frequencies.  They suggest the existence of  large scale ordered magnetic field {\bf B} in the radio lobes of M87.

\subsection{Cygnus A}
Cygnus A is a typical radio galaxy with twin jets of plasma emanating from its nucleus and forming two extended, radio- emitting lobes. 
It is  the most powerful Fanaroff- Riley II (FRII) radio galaxy in the local environment.
It has been well studied in terms of spatial resolution as it lies
at a distance of 227 Mpc. The global properties of the object are
reviewed in the literature.  

At low radio frequencies, the synchrotron emission
from the two giant lobes dominate \citep{1974MNRAS.166..305H}. At higher frequencies the
hotspots (working surfaces in the lobes) and the galaxy core become more prominent.
The southern and northern hotspots are respectively 50 and 70 arcsec from the core.
The complex structure of Cygnus A can be well explained by assuming that Cygnus A consists of two components which are polarized in opposite directions \citep{1967ApJ...150L..15S}, \citep{1966SvA....10..214S}, \citep{1968ApJ...151...53M}.

The {\it NIKA} Stokes parameters $I, Q, U$ maps of Cygnus A at 260 GHz (top) and 150 (bottom) GHz are presented in
the first and second row of Fig. \ref{cygnusa_maps}.  
The  unpolarized core of the source in the $Q$ and $U$ maps show the low level of instrumental polarization which affects polarization measurements and show the polarization of the jets with an opposite orientation of the polarization angle, as expected.

As expected, the
two hot spots and the galaxy core dominate the signal at the {\it NIKA}
frequencies. The peak flux of the $I$ map is $\sim$ 1.7 Jy/beam and $\sim$ 3 Jy/beam at 260 GHz and 150 GHz, respectively. 

The leakage maps found for this source are shown in Fig. \ref{cygnusa_leakage}, the effect is comparable to the quasar leakage effect, for Cygnus A appears as a compact source at {\it NIKA} frequencies. 

The polarization intensity at both frequencies is shown in Fig. \ref{cygnusa_ipol}. In Fig. \ref{cygnusa_vector} we show the Stokes vector $I$ with the vectors indicating the orientation of the polarization angle. 




%The hot spots present a spectral index (right map on the row) in
%the range -1.5 to -2.0, which is consistent with synchrotron emission but
%steeper than the value found by \citet{1998MNRAS.301..935R}, which is $\sim

%-1$. The galaxy core shows a flatter spectrum from -0.6 to -1.0, which is
%consistent with previous estimates from \citet{1999IAUS..194..179L}.

 
 \section{Conclusions}
This paper has shown the first polarization measurements with Kinetic Inductance Detectors technology. The efficiency of the polarization system adopted, consisting of an achromatic rotating Half Wave Plate plus a polarizer, has been demonstrated in detection of the polarization of few quasars, Orion OMC-1 molecular cloud and the radio galaxies M87 and Cygnus A. 
 
 A systematic leakage effect of total intensity into polarization shows up at the 3\% level for point sources and 2\% for extended sources. 
 We have been able to correct for it using calibration scan on Uranus on all observations shown in the section \ref{sec:polar_pipe}.
 
 {\it NIKA} was the test bench of {\it NIKA}2 camera, which observes at the same frequencies of {\it NIKA} with improved main performance and covering a Field of View (Fov) of 6.5 arcminutes. {\it NIKA} has been installed at the IRAM 30 meter telescope in Spain on October 2015 and it will be opened to public observations in late 2016. 
 
 {\it NIKA}2 has polarization capability at 260 GHz; the warm rotating HWP is placed in front of the {\it NIKA}2 cryostat and and the polarizer is mounted in the 100 mK stage of the cryostat splitting the two orientations of the linear polarization on two matrix of thousands of pixels.
 
The {\it NIKA}2 polarization channel will provide high angular resolutions observations of Galactic regions dust emission and would be clarify the understanding of the magnetic fields role in star formation process.
