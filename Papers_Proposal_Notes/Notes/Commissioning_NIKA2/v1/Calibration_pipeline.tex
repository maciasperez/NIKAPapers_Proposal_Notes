\subsection{Overview of the calibration pipeline}

The steps to go from raw timeline data in Hertz to calibrated data in Jansky per beam comprize:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Opacity correction
\item[] Field-of-view geometry and KIDs selection
\item[] KID-to-KID intercalibration (flat fielding)
\item[] Absolute calibration  
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Data reduction summary}

The performance assessment relies on a data reduction pipeline that consists of the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] reading of the raw timeline 
\item[] implementation of the calibration
\item[] substraction of the correlated part of the noise 
\item[] projection of the timeline onto maps
\end{itemize}
