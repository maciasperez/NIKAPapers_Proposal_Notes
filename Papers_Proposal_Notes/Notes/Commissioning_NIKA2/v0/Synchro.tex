\paragraph{NIKA2 synchronization scheme}
NIKA2 reference clock is the \emph{pulse per second} (pps)  [TO BE DEVELOPPED A BIT]

\paragraph{Synchronization between instrument and scan information}
A list of network specifications has been provided to IRAM by the NIKA2 consortium. A thorough characterization of the delay in receiving the telescope messages will be led by Francesco P.

\paragraph{Synchronization between instrument and telescope coordinates}
Albrecht S. to lead the characterization.

A final characterization of the accuracy of the dating of each sample will be undergone using \emph{zigzag} scans acquired in excellent weather conditions.
