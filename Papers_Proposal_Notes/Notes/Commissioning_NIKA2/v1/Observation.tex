\section{Calibration and commissioning observations at the 30\,m telescope}% {\color{YellowGreen} Nico}}

This section presents the different observation modes that have been used with
\nika\ for both commissioning and scientific purposes. Some of them are common
to usual IRAM observing modes (e.g.~''on the fly'' raster scans), some of them
have been designed specifically for \nika\ (e.g.~the focus sequence). We start
by a short overview of a typical set up sequence at the beginning of
an observational run. This
will put each observation mode in perspective. Then we go into more details
about the performances of the system.

\subsection{Overview of different types of scans}

Once the KIDs are tuned and \nika\ is ready for observations, before actually
observing a scientific target, one needs to adjust the focus and pointing of the
telescope. In the case of EMIR typically, these two parameters are adjusted iteratively by
alterning ``pointing'' (\aka\ ``cross'') and ``focus'' scans to optimize the
centering of a bright point source on a reference detector and to maximize the
incoming flux on it. With \nika\ , mostly due to absence of horns, this
procedure is not optimal. Indeed, it was noticed that the position of the source
moved by several arcsec with the displacement of M2
\vu{during the focus procedure} and this would alter the flux
measurement on a fixed reference position too much to enable focus
optimization.

To solve this issue we have designed a specific focus procedure that takes
advantage of the dense sampling of the FOV that allows to map a source with only
a few subscans. We perform a series of five successive short raster scans of a
bright point source at five M2 position offsets along the optical axis.%, typically
%$\{-0.8, -0.4, 0, 0.4, 0.8\}$\,mm w.r.t.~the current $z$-focus (which
%is usually the previous optimal $z$-focus value).
We then analyse each map to optimize the $z$ position of M2. More details are given in
Sect.~\ref{se:axial_focus}.
Once the focus is correctly determined, the pointing
corrections are derived from an EMIR like pointing calibration scan
(Sect.~\ref{se:pointing}). The instrument is then ready to observe scientific
targets.

\subsection{Axial focus}
\label{se:axial_focus}

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\caption[Axial focus measurement]{Example of axial focus measurement using a
  \emph{focus$\_$OTF} observation of Neptune during N2R10. \vu{Flux (first
  row), FWHM (second row) and ellipticity (third row) measurements are
  shown as a function of the axial focus offsets for Array 1 (first
  column), Array 2 (second column) and Array 3 (third column). The
  best-fitting parabola is shown in red. To help the observer
  assessing the parabolic fit quality, the best-fit linear model is also drawn
  with dashed black lines.} 
  The blue vertical line locates the best-fitting $z$-focus value of
  each fit. The optimal focus values derived from flux
  maximization and FWHM minimization agree to better than 0.1\,mm in these
  conditions of observation. While ellipticity may be regarded as a confirmation
  more than a decisive criterion (due to larger uncertainty on its measure), the
  associated minimum is also in good agreement with the values derived from flux
  and FWHM measurements.}
\label{fig:focus-example}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The best axial focus in the central region of the arrays is estimated using the
so-called \emph{focus$\_$OTF} PAKO script, which produces a series of five $1'
\times 5'$ OTF scans at various values of the focus in $0.4~\rm{mm}$ steps
around an \emph{a priori} value $z_0$, namely
$z \in \{-0.8, -0.4, 0, 0.4, 0.8\} + z_0$.
Elliptical Gaussian fits on the reconstructed maps provide estimates of
the flux and FWHM along minor - and major - axes for each focus. Parabolic fits are
then used to determine the best focus. We consider three estimates: i) $\hat
z_{\rm{peak}}$ the focus that maximizes the estimated flux, which is the
amplitude of the 2D Gaussian, ii) $\hat z_{\rm{fwhm}}$ the focus that minimizes
the geometrical FWHM, defined as the quadratic mean of $\rm{FWHM}_{\rm{major}}$
and $\rm{FWHM}_{\rm{minor}}$, and iii) $\hat z_{\rm{ellipt}}$ the focus that
minimizes the beam ellipticity, defined as
$\rm{FWHM}_{\rm{major}}/\rm{FWHM}_{\rm{minor}}$. Fig.~\ref{fig:focus-example}
shows an example of such a sequence. When deciding on the focus to apply, we
give priority to the optimal flux, taking an average between values on A1 and
A3: there is little difference between the two and the 2\,mm channel is
less sensitive to the focus change than the 1\,mm.

As presented in more details in Sect.~\ref{sec:focus_surfaces}, the focus
surface is not strictly flat across the FOV. The way sources are scanned in
this \emph{focus\_OTF} sequence is designed to save time but it gives more weight
to the central KIDs. Hence, the optimal focus derived from the fits is
biased. To account for the curvature of the focus surfaces and optimize the
average focus across the FOV, we add -0.2\,mm to the best-fit focus value as derived
in the previous paragraph. \vu{This focus offset is derived using ZEMAX
simulation and it is verified on data as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{sec:focus_surfaces}.}

\subsection{Lateral focus}
\label{sec:focus_X_Y}

Like in the $z$ (optical axis) direction, it is possible to control the position
of M2 along the $x$ and $y$ directions. We have tried to determine if there was
an optimal position in the $(x,y)$ plane that would improve further measurements
with \nika. We have applied the same procedure as the one described in
Sect~\ref{se:axial_focus}, this time varying the position of M2 along $x$ or $y$
rather than along $z$. Examples of such observations are presented on
Figs.~\ref{fig:X_focus} and \ref{fig:Y_focus}. While the forced parabola fit
guides the eye towards optimization, one should note the size of the error bars
and the relatively low variations compared to M2 displacements along the $z$
axis. This is expected from optical simulations and experience on
EMIR. Figs.~\ref{fig:X_focus} and \ref{fig:Y_focus} also show as complement,
images of the residuals of the intensity maps at each M2 position after the
subtraction of an elliptical gaussian fitted only on a disk of 6 and 15\,arcsec
(1 and 2\,mm resp.) around the maximum location and outside a ring of 100\,arcsec
away from the maximum (to fix the background while not being affected by the
side lobes). These maps of residuals are meant to help to decide on a minimization
criterion and $x$ or $y$-focus value.

While we have performed ``many'' of such observations and explored the entire
parameter space of the $(x,y,z)$~triplet position in a reasonable range of
several millimeters around a fixed position, it has not been possible to
demonstrate that any $(x,y)$ positions would improve significantly the
focusing of the whole system compared to the nominal $(0,0)$ reference
position. \vu{This confirms the experience of the IRAM staff with EMIR and
HERA who only act on this $(x,y)$ position about once a year after
specific, dedicated and delicate measures. This effort is necessary
to find an optimum lateral focus position which is stable with
elevation. For \nika\, the adopted strategy has been not to change the
lateral focus parameters and only rely on $z$-focus optimization for
observations. However, lateral focus measurements with NIKA2 have to be
scheduled in the future.} 
%We have therefore concluded that we should not change these
%parameters for \nika\ and only rely on $z$-focus optimization for observations.

\subsection{Pointing}
\label{se:pointing}
% + RTA pointing estimate method
% + pointing model
% + pointing error (scan-to-scan scattering)

Once the instrument is correctly focused, we can estimate pointing corrections
before scientific observations.
%The procedure that is used is very similar to
%that used for EMIR and is described in the next subsection.
\vu{Even though EMIR only has a single pixel on the sky, the pointing procedure
used for NIKA2 is very similar and is described in the next subsections.}
%It was used
%repeatedly during pointing sessions to derive the pointing model of.

\paragraph{Pointing monitoring}

  centre of the map. The pointing reference detector of
  \nika\ is the 2\,mm reference detector, the azimuth
  and elevation profiles of which are shown in the central bottom
  plot. The location of the peak in azimuth and elevation, as observed by the
  reference detector gives the pointing offsets of the current scan.

\label{fig:pointing_stats_n2r9}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Based on general operating experience at the 30\,m telescope, we use the so-called
{\em pointing} or {\em cross} scans to monitor the pointing during observations. The
telescope executes a back and forth scan in azimuth and a back and forth scan in
elevation, centered on the observed source. Looking at the timeline profiles of
the reference detector, we fit gaussian profiles and derive the current pointing
offsets of the system in azimuth and elevation. These offsets can then be passed
to PAKO to recenter the next scan (Fig.~\ref{fig:ptg}).

\paragraph{Pointing session}
\label{se:pointing_session}

Such scans and their analyses are also used to improve the pointing model of
\nika. A pointing session consists in observing about 30 sources on a wide range
of elevations \new{and azimuth angles} while monitoring the pointing
offsets that are measured for each
observation. These offsets are then passed to the IRAM staff who finds the
pointing model parameters that minimize and symmetrize the scattering of these
offsets. Based on these results, Nasmyth offsets
\todo{to define Nasmyth offsets} are then
modified. Fig.~\ref{fig:pointing_stats_n2r9} shows the pointing corrections that
had to be applied during Run9, before and after the modification of the Nasmyth
offsets. The dispersion of the offsets is the figure of merit of the pointing
corrections. Their distribution after the corrections (in yellow to
red) is clearly more symmetric and narrower than before. During N2R9 run, the
pointing accuracy was 1.62\,arcsec rms in azimuth and 1.37\,arcsec rms in
elevation. \todo{Marco's question: est-ce que les offsets trouv\'es sont les memes qu'EMIR ? Are the best parameters "only telescope" or "telescope+instrument at focal plane" dependent?}

\subsection{Skydip}
\label{se:skydip}

A {\tt skydip} scan \new{with NIKA2} consists in a step-by-step span
of a large range of elevations. This is used in order to calibrate the
KIDs response to the atmosphere for opacity derivation, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:opacities}.
\new{Whereas with the heterodyne receivers, skydips can be
  conducted continuously slewing the telescope in elevation, this
  option is not feasible with NIKA2, as the KIDs need to be retuned
  for a given airmass.}
For that purpose, a NIKA2 skydip comprizes eleven steps in
the elevation range from 19 to 65 degrees, regularly spaced in
airmass. For each step, we acquire about twenty seconds of time traces
to ensure a precise monitoring of each KIDs. KIDs are tuned at the beginning of
each subscan (hence once per airmass). The variation of their resonance
frequency reads

\begin{equation}
  %\ftone^k  = C_0^k - C_1^k T_{atm}[1-e^{-\tau/\sin\delta}]
  f_{\rm{reso}}^k  = C_0^k - C_1^k T_{atm}[1-e^{-\tau/\sin\delta}]
\label{eq:skydip_1}
\end{equation}

An illustration is presented on Fig.~\ref{fig:ftone_vs_elev}. More details on
the analysis of these {\tt skydip} scans are given in Sect.~\ref{se:opacities}.

\subsection{\bms}
\label{se:beammaps}

A \bm\ is \new{a scan procedure to map} a bright and compact
source, most of the time a planet, with
an elevation step small enough to meet Nyquist sampling of the 1\,mm beam,
namely 4.8~arcsec. We observe the planet with a raster scan in (az,el)
coordinates of $13\times7.8$~arcmin$^2$, either with fixed elevation subscans or
fixed azimuth subscans. The former has the advantage of low air mass variation
across a subscan, the latter offers an orthogonal scan direction to the former:
the combination of both gives a more accurate determination of the far side
lobes. The scan size ensures that the entire FOV is observed with good margins
for beam mapping even on the edges and good margins for baseline derivation and
subtraction in the scanning direction. During subscans, the telescope travels at
65\,arcsec/s. This value results of a tradeoff between the need to scan as
fast as possible to minimize atmospheric contamination and the
necessity to keep subscans no shorter than 10\,s (telescope
constraint). The need to have Nyquist sampling of
the beams along the scan direction translates into a maximum speed of 110\,arcsec/s
for our nominal acquisition rate of 23.8\,Hz and is thus largely met. Subscans
last 12\,s, the entire scan lasts about 25\,min, which is short enough to prevent
too much variation of KID tuning under stable weather conditions on this
timescale.

More details on these observations are given in Sect.~\ref{se:fp_reconstruction}
where we describe how to actually exploit them to derive individual KID
properties.
