%\section{Beam Pattern}
%\label{se:beam}

%The NIKA2 beam pattern mainly depends on the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope and
%NIKA2 full (external and internal) optical system characteristics,
%whereas the detectors themselves have an impact at sub-dominant
%level (through \emph{e.g.} the KID size, time constants or correlated noise).
%It is important to specify that the detectors impact on the size of the
%beam pattern, when you include the size of the pixel, and on the
%measure of the beam pattern with their time constants and noise.
{\lp The NIKA2 full beam pattern originates from the KIDs illuminating the internal
and external optics, out to the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope primary mirror.}
To characterize the full beam pattern, we use \bm\ observations. First,
deep integration maps of bright sources are produced to provide a
qualitative description of the complex beam structure in
Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam}. Then we model the beam using three
complementary methods to estimate the main beam angular resolution
(Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam}) and the beam efficiency
(Sect.~\ref{se:beam_efficiency}).

\subsection{Full beam pattern}
\label{se:fullbeam}

To study the two-dimensional pattern of the beam, we 
primarily use a map obtained from a combination of \bm\ observations
of strong point sources acquired during the N2R9 commissioning campaign.
%N2R8 and N2R9 technical campaigns.
Namely, we use \bm\ scans of Uranus%(scan id '20170125s223' and '20170125s243')
,  Neptune %('20170224s177')
and the bright quasar 3C84. %('20170226s415').
Furthermore, we checked the stability of our results on single scan
maps, combinations of scans for a single source, and combinations of
shallower scans but spanning a large range of scanning direction. {\lp
The \bm\ scans are reduced using the method discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc} to produce maps.}
{\lp Figure~\ref{fig:features} shows the two-dimensional beam pattern
as measured with NIKA2 using the former \bm\ combination, for each of
the arrays and for the $1\,\rm{mm}$ array combination.}
{\lp The beam pattern is shown over a large dynamic range down
to about $-40\,\rm{dB}$ and out to radii of about 5’.
The telescope beam pattern further extends well beyond this radius, as for
example shown by lunar edge observations
%with heterodyne front-ends installed
at the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope~\citep{Greve1998,
Kramer2013}. However,
this extended pattern is at present difficult to detect using the data
reduction pipeline discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}, as
the extended error beams are both filtered and mixed with 
atmospheric and electronics large-scale correlated noise
residuals. {\rev We expect the filtering effect due to the data
processing to become non negligible for angular scales larger than
90'', which corresponds to the radial size of the mask used in the
correlated noise subtraction process (see Sect.~\ref{se:toi_proc}).}
The contributions to the beam pattern that stem from larger angular scales are
further discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_efficiency}.} 
%are difficult to distinguish from common mode variations of the atmosphere or electronics.}

%The data processing includes a mitigation of the correlated noise, which
%mainly originates from the atmosphere.  We primarly use a subtraction
%of a common mode estimated from the most correlated detectors (the
%so-called 'cm one block' method). However, other methods are tested
%for assessing the immunity of our results to noise residuals.

The NIKA2 beam maps reveal some noticeable features, which are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:features}. Ranging from strong and/or extended to
weak and/or spiky, they include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the main beam and the underlying first error
  beam, which is due to large-scale deformations of the primary
  mirror, and the first side lobes, {\lp which correspond to various diffraction
  patterns. In particular, the 60'' and 85'' diameter (square-like shaped) side
  lobes at $1$ and $2\,\rm{mm}$, respectively, at a level lower than
  $-20\,\rm{dB}$, are due to the convolution of the primary mirror and the
  quadrupod diffraction pattern with the pixel (KID) transfer function;}
  %The latter include 
  %the 20" diameter first side lobe and the 60" diameter (squarish)
  %side lobe, which is due to the convolution of the primary mirror and
  %quadrupod diffraction pattern with the pixel (KID) transfer function;
  %The four symmetrical spokes of the error beam as shown by
  %yellow arrows in the A2 panel, are expected from ZEMAX
  %simulations;
   %The 20”/60” “lobes” refer to 1mm or 2mm ? Here, we mixing the terms
  %“error beams” and “side lobes”. Aren’t the 20” diameter “1st side
  %lobe” and the “1st error beam” the same ?  To my understanding, side
  %lobes show up in the maps as rings, e.g. diffraction patterns. Error
  %beams, on the other hand, show-up as broad Gaussians entered on the
  %main beam. The section on the radial averages should take up the
  %discussion of 20” and 60” diameter error beams, and actually show
  %them in the figures.
\item at a much lower level of about $-30\,\rm{dB}$, a diffraction ring shows    
up, which is presumably caused by panel buckling of the primary 
  mirror~\citep{Greve2010}, as shown with a red circle in the A1 panel;
\item also at a level of about $-30\,\rm{dB}$, the side lobes shown with green
  diagonal lines in the A2 panel are due to diffraction on the
  quadrupod holding the secondary mirror of the telescope, as expected
  from ZEMAX simulations;  
\item spikes of not fully understood origin marked by yellow
  arrows. The ones that are along the vertical and
  horizontal axes are reproduced by ZEMAX simulations but at a 
  shallower level, whereas the ones shown in the A3 panel in the
  diagonal directions may be due to the small cylindrical
  instrumentation box on the side of the M2 cabin. The origin of the
  asymmetry on the 1~mm arrays is unknown but most probably due to
  internal optics aberrations;
\item shallow spikes of unknown origin at a level less than $-30\,\rm{dB}$, which are circled by pink
  ellipses. The multiple images on the combined deep beam map indicate
  a rotation of these spikes with the observing elevation, which in
  turn point to diffraction related issue or a ghost image that are
  formed inside the cryostat. These shallow features are expected to
  have no significant impact on NIKA2 science results.
\end{enumerate}

We further quantify the respective level of the axi-symmetrical
features of the beam pattern by evaluating the beam radial profile
$B_\nu(r)$, which is the normalized radial brightness profile for the
array $\nu$, where $r$ is the radius from the beam center.
%is the azimuthal average of the beam map around the
%main beam center.
Although the profile cannot represent the sub-dominant non-axisymmetrical
features, which are seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:features} (quadrupod
diffraction pattern, spikes), it provides a useful
representation of the internal and central parts of the beam {\lp up to
 about $180''$.} We determine a beam profile from a beam map in centring to
the fitted value of the main beam center and in computing the
weighted average of the map pixels in annular rings.

We checked the stability of the beam against various
observing conditions (source intensity, weather condition, focus
optimisation) by comparing the beam profiles of a series of 18 \bm\
observations.
This set of \bms, which is referred to as {\tt BM18}, has been
selected from all the available \bm\ scans at optimal focus using the
baseline scan selection criteria (Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}).
%The 18 beam profiles and their difference w.r.t. the median beam
%profile are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam_prof}.
The measured beam profiles using the {\tt BM18} data set are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:beam_prof}. {\lp The profiles consist of the main beam and
the first error beams and side lobes, which significantly contribute
at levels of less than $-10\,\rm{dB}$ at both observing
wavelengths. Moreover, at $1\,\rm{mm}$ the contribution of the
diffraction ring, which was marked with a red circle in Fig.~\ref{fig:features},
is seen as a peak at a level up to $-33\,\rm{dB}$ located at a radius
of about $115''$.} Calculating the {\lp rms of the relative}
difference of the beam profiles to the median beam profile, we find a
dispersion below $5\%$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and below $2\%$ at
$2\,\rm{mm}$.

{\lp To measure the relative level of the axi-symmetrical beam pattern
features, we further model the beam profiles using an empirical function,
which accounts for the main beam and for a significant fraction of the
error beams and the side lobes. We define this function $B_{3G}(r)$ as:
\begin{equation}
  B_{3G}(r) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \mathcal{A}_i G_i(r) + \mathcal{B}_0,
  \label{eq:3gauss}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{A}_i$ is the amplitude of the Gaussian $G_i$ for
$i \in {1, 2, 3}$ and $\mathcal{B}_0$ a pedestal level accounting for
the residual background level in the map. The measured beam profiles
are fitted using Eq.~\ref{eq:3gauss} and the median best-fit
parameters are given in Table~\ref{tab:mean_3gauss_fit}. The errors
are evaluated as the standard deviation of the best-fitting parameter
values of the 18 \bm\ scans of {\tt BM18}.
These values are given to gain insight of beam profile, but are not
used for the calibration procedure. We find the level of the first error
beam with respect to the total beam at about $-11\,\rm{dB}$ and
$-13\,\rm{dB}$ at 1 and $2\,\rm{mm}$, respectively.}

\subsection{Main beam}
\label{se:mainbeam}

NIKA2 angular resolution {\lp is characterized using the FWHM of a
Gaussian fitted to the main beam. This principal Gaussian encloses
most of the measured flux density of a point-like source.} %However, the
%telescope beam consists of more components, as shown in the previous
%paragraphs.
%We have developped
%three different methods for the NIKA2 main beam characterisation
%, which are detailed
%in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_methods}. Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_dataset}
%presents the observing scans that we have selected to derive the results
%discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_results}. We check the stability
%of the FWHM estimate against the observing conditions in
%Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_stability}.

\subsubsection{Main beam characterization methods}
\label{se:mainbeam_methods}
To characterize the main beam and to derive an estimate of its FWHM, we
have developed three methods. The two first methods, quoted
{\tt Prof-3G} and {\tt Prof-1G}, rely on a fit of the beam profile to
benefit from the signal-to-noise ratio increase after azimuthally
averaging the signal. The last one by contrast,
consists in an elliptical Gaussian fit of the beam map for a better
2D modelling, and is labelled {\tt Map-1G}. They are presented in more
detail below. \\

\noindent {\tt Prof-3G} consists in fitting the beam profile using the
three-Gaussian function defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:3gauss}.
%, and derive the FWHM from the main beam parameter.
 The main beam FWHM estimate is given by the best-fitting value
of the FWHM for the first Gaussian function. {\lp This main beam FWHM
estimate is expected to be immune to the first error beams
and side lobes, which are well accounted for. For consistency checks,
we also relies on two other methods that rely on simpler beam models.}\\

\noindent {\tt Prof-1G} relies on fitting a single Gaussian to the beam
profile after masking the portion of the profile where the
contributions of the side lobes and error beams are the
largest. Specifically, the side lobe mask is designed to cut out {\lp the
radius ranging from an inner radius
$r_{\rm{in}} = 0.65\, \mathrm{FWHM}_0,$, where FWHM$_0$ is the
reference Gaussian beam FWHM (see Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system})
to an outer radius $r_{\rm{out}} = 80''$,} centred on the beam
maximum.
%At radial distances
%greater than $80''$, the profile measurement provides the base level
%for the Gaussian fit.
The profile is estimated up to a radius of
$180''$, that is in the inner part of the beam map where the noise
variance is uniform.\\

\noindent {\tt Map-1G} consists in modelling the two-dimensional distribution of
the main beam using an 2D elliptical Gaussian of size $\sigma_x$ and
$\sigma_y$. We characterize the NIKA2 main beam using
\begin{equation}
  FWHM = 2 \sqrt{2\ln {2}\, \sigma_x\sigma_y}.
  \label{eq:fwhm_geom}
\end{equation}
%where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ are the Gaussian standard deviation
%along minor and major axis.
As in {\tt Prof-1G}, we use masked versions of the
beam map to avoid side lobe and error beam contaminations. 
%The mask cuts an annulus of inner radius
%$r_{\rm{in}}$ and outer radius $r_{\rm{out}}$ centered on the beam
%maximum.
Whereas $r_{\rm{out}}$ is conservatively set to be $100''$,
$r_{\rm{in}}$ is let free to vary around a central value of about $8''$
for A1 and A3 and of about $12''$ for A2 to provide the best 2D Gaussian
fit.

\subsubsection{Data sets for the main beam determination}
\label{se:mainbeam_dataset}

We select a sub-set of the selected \bm\ scans described in
Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam} by discarding scans of Mars. {\lp Indeed, \bms\
towards Mars unveil the complex full beam pattern, which extends beyond
radii of $100''$, so that the annulus sidelobe mask used in {\tt
Prof-1G} and {\tt Map-1G} is not sufficient to mitigate the error
beams and sidelobes effects.}
The 12 remaining \bm\ scans are analysed using the data reduction
pipeline of Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc} and projected onto maps
with a resolution of $1''$ and an angular size of $10'$. This data set
is referred to as {\tt BM12}.

We also consider series of shorter integration scans. We select
$5' \times 8'$ raster scans of moderately bright to very bright point
sources by thresholding the flux density estimates at $1~\rm{Jy}$ at both
wavelengths. %Slightly extended sources, such as Mars, NGC7027 and
%CRL2688 are discarded.
After the baseline scan selection, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}, the data set comprises 154 %163
scans towards the giant planets Uranus and Neptune, the secondary calibrator
MWC349 and the quasars 3C84, 3C273, 3C345 and 3C454 (aka
2251+158). For these short scans, which are referred to as {\tt
R154}, the data are reduced and projected onto $2''$
resolution maps. 

{\lp Finally, we use a series of 75 observation scans of Uranus and
Neptune, which includes both \bm\ and $5' \times 8'$ raster scans. 
This data set, which is referred to as {\tt UN75}, consists of all the
scans of Uranus and Neptune acquired during the \emph{reference}
observation campaigns (N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14).}


\subsubsection{Results}
\label{se:mainbeam_results}

We have derived the main beam FWHM for the three arrays and the
$1\,\rm{mm}$ arrays combination using the three methods presented in
Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_methods} and the data
sets of Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_dataset}.
%First, we test the stability of the FWHM estimates against the choices
%of the estimation method by comparing the median FWHM estimate using
%{\tt Prof 1} with the {\tt 2D beam} average FWHM from the 12 \bm\ scan
%sub-set.
Namely, our main beam FWHM estimates
consist of i) the median FWHM estimate using {\tt Prof-3G} on the
{\tt BM12} dataset, ii) the average FWHM estimate using {\tt Prof-1G}
on the {\tt UN75} data set and the {\tt Map-1G} average FWHM using
either {\tt BM12} or {\tt R154}. 
By comparing these results, we test the stability of the FWHM
estimates against the choices of the data set and of the estimation
method. %We also seek at validating the FWHM estimates using
%{\tt Prof 2}, which is further used to derive the beam efficiency in
%Sect.~\ref{se:beam_efficiency}.

In the case of Uranus, the FWHM estimates are further corrected for
the {\lp average beam broadening induced by the extension of the
apparent disc of the planet, which is $0.19''$ and $0.12''$ at 1 and
$2\,\rm{mm}$, respectively.}
%At the IRAM $30\,\rm{m}$ latitude,
{\lp During the observation period, Uranus disc diameter has varied
from $3.3''$ to $3.7''$. This diameter variation translates into beam
broadening variations of an amplitude of a few tenth of arcseconds,
which are neglected.}  
%This induces a broadening of the Gaussian main beam of
%$0.19 \pm 0.03\,\rm{arcsec}$ at $1\, \rm{mm}$ and $0.12 \pm 0.02\,\rm{arcsec}$
%at $2\, \rm{mm}$. Uranus FWHM estimates are corrected for the average beam
%widening values.

The results of this analysis are
gathered in Table~\ref{tab:fwhm}, including uncertainties evaluated as
the rms dispersion of single-scan based FWHM estimates.
{\tt Prof-1G} and {\tt Map-1G} results are in agreement within
uncertainties, whereas {\tt Prof-3G} yields slightly smaller FWHM.
%All the tests based on {\tt Prof 2} and {\tt 2D beam}, which both
%resort to a sidelobe mask, yield FWHM estimates
%in agreement within error bars, whereas the test using {\tt Prof 1}
%yields slightly smaller FWHM for all arrays.
%The latter provides us with lower limits for the main beam FWHM.
%The latter constitute optimistic estimates of the FWHM. 
{\lp The latter is more robust against the error beams and large radii
beam features than the formers, as expected.}
Combined results are obtained from an error-weighted
average of the four FWHM estimates for each array.
Because the rms errors estimated using the 12 \bm\ scans may be
optimistic considering the small statistic, they are conservatively
increased to match the uncertainty estimates based on the {\tt R154}
data set before performing the weighted average.  
%The uncertainties are the most robustly derived from the dispersion of the
%best-fitting FWHM over the set of 154 OTF scans, whereas rms errors
%that are estimated from smaller and more homogeneous scan sets may be
%optimistic. Combined results are obtained from an error-weighted
%average of the four FWHM estimates for each array.
%The 12 \bm\ scan
%based rms errors were replaced by the 154 OTF scan based rms errors
%beforehand.
The combined results, as given in
Table~\ref{tab:fwhm}, provide a robust evaluation of the
FWHM. Hence, we report main beam FWHMs of $11.1'' \pm 0.2''$ at
$1\, \rm{mm}$ and $17.6''\pm 0.1''$ at $2\, \rm{mm}$.

%evaluated as the cosecant of the observing elevation.
The main beam FWHM estimates using data of the three campaigns are in
agreement within rms errors. Moreover, the main beam FWHM is stable
against atmospheric conditions at both wavelengths. Slightly lower
values than average (about $11''$) are observed in the best
atmospheric conditions at $1\,\rm{mm}$ providing us with a lower limit
in the absence of correlated atmospheric noise residuals. We note
three scans acquired during the N2R12 campaign with larger FWHM than average at
$2\,\rm{mm}$ although the atmospheric transmission was excellent: this
is likely an effect of atmospheric instabilities%the anomalous refraction
, which affected a large number of observation scans during N2R12.

\subsection{Main beam efficiency}
\label{se:beam_efficiency}

%Building upon the description of the full-beam pattern in
%Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam} and the main beam in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam},
We derive the main beam efficiency for each array, which is defined as the
ratio of the solid angle sustained by the main beam to the total beam
solid angle.

{\rev To estimate the total beam solid angle, we primarily use the maps
of the beam pattern presented in Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam}, which
provide us with accurate representation of the main beam and of the
first error beams. However, at angular scales larger than the radius
of the noise decorrelation mask, 90'', the
filtering effect induced by the data processing becomes
non negligible (see also Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}). Furthermore,
heterodyne observations at the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope
towards the lunar edge and estimates of the forward beam efficiency using
skydips show that a significant fraction of the full beam stems
from angular scales much larger than $90''$~\citep{Greve1998,
Kramer2013}. Thus, the accurate assessment of the total beam solid
angle requires to account for the filtering effect and the large
angular scales contributions. To that aim, we resort to an hybrid
approach. We utilize both the full beam pattern measurements with
NIKA2 as presented in Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam}, and the results of the
IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope beam pattern characterization using EMIR
front-end observations~\citep{Carter2012}, as reported
in \citet{Kramer2013}. These results came in two flavours.}

{\rev First, the main beam and error beams are measured using
observations towards the limbs of the Moon. As EMIR detectors were coupled to
the \trentemetre\ telescope entrance pupil via corrugated horns, the
contribution of the first error beam is significantly attenuated
compared to the NIKA2 case. In fact, the first error beam measured by
NIKA2 is not detected with EMIR, while the second error beam is
measured with both NIKA2 and EMIR at compatible levels. The third and
fourth error beams, which originate from the IRAM \trentemetre\
telescope frame misalignment and panel deformations, respectively, are
expected to be measured by EMIR without
attenuation~\citep{Kramer2013}. We assume these latter are
characteristics of the \trentemetre\ telescope without any significant
dependencies on the receiver instrument.}

{\rev Second, the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope forward efficiencies
$F_{\rm{eff}}$ are derived using skydip scans with EMIR. Their
measurements allow us to estimate the far side lobes efficiencies,
which receive two different contributions. The \emph{forward}
spillover and scattering efficiencies are estimated as $F_{\rm{eff}}$
subtracted from the main beam and error beams efficiencies, and
the \emph{rearward} spillover and scattering efficiencies equal
$1-F_{\rm{eff}}$~\citep{Kramer2013}.}

{\rev To sum up, we estimate the solid angle of the total beam as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \Omega_{\rm{tot}}(\nu) =& \int_0^{2\pi} \left( \tilde{B}_{\nu}(r)
  + \mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{(3)} G_{\nu}^{(3)}(r) + \mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{(4)}
  G_{\nu}^{(4)}(r) \right)  2 \pi r dr  \\
  &+ \,  \Omega_{\rm{FSL}}
  (\nu),
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:omega_tot}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{B}_{\nu}(r)$ is the normalised beam profile $B_{\nu}(r)$
for the array $\nu$, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam}, after
rescaling with a factor of
$(1-\mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{(3)}-\mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{(4)})$; 
$\mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{(3)}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{(4)}$ are the
amplitudes of the third and fourth Gaussian error beams
$G_{\nu}^{(3)}$ and $G_{\nu}^{(4)}$, respectively, which are measured
with EMIR and extrapolated for the array $\nu$ following the
prescription given in \citet{Kramer2013}; $\Omega_{\rm{FSL}} (\nu)$ is
the contribution of the far side lobes to the total beam solid angle
of the array $\nu$, as derived from $F_{\rm{eff}}$ measurements.}

{\rev In addition, for cross-checks and stability tests, we also compute the
total beam solid angle up to a maximum radius
\begin{equation}
 \Omega_{r_{\rm{max}}} (\nu) = \int_0^{r_{\rm max}} B_{\nu}(r)  \,  2 \pi r dr, 
\label{eq:omega_rmax}
\end{equation}
where $r_{\rm{max}}$ is taken as the largest radius for which the
filtering effect of the data processing has no significant impact.
We take $r_{\rm{max}}$ as the radius of the noise decorrelation mask,
which is 90'' and evaluate {\rev $\Omega_{90}$} from the measured beam profiles
obtained using the {\tt UN75} data set (see Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_dataset}).
Results per observational campaigns, with uncertainties evaluated
as the rms scatter on the average, are given in
Table~\ref{tab:solid}. The $\Omega_{90}$ estimates are statistically
compatible from one campaign to another with some variations of the
average value due to the dispersion in the focus settings and
atmospheric conditions that prevail during each campaign. The combined
results, based on the whole {\tt UN75} data set, are the
inverse-variance weighted average of the $\Omega_{90}$ for the three
campaigns, while the error bars are conservatively estimated as the
maximum half-difference between the $\Omega_{90}$ estimates.}

%The main beam solid angle is evaluated from the main beam (mb) FWHM, as
%$\Omega_{\rm{mb}} = 2 \pi\,  \sigma_{\rm{mb}}^2$, where
%FWHM$ = 2\sqrt{2\ln{2}}\, \sigma_{\rm{mb}}$. 

%We derive an estimate of the total beam solid angle
%\begin{equation}
%  \Omega_{\rm{tot}} (\nu, r_{max}) = \int_0^{r_{max}} B_{\nu}(r) \,  2 \pi r dr
%  \label{eq:omega_tot}
%\end{equation}
%from the normalized beam profile $B_\nu(r)$ of the array
%$\nu$ integrated up to $r_{max} = 180''$. {\lp Hereafter, we refer to
%this total beam solid angle estimate as $\Omega_{180}$.}
%The choice of the maximum radius is set both by the integration depth of
%the \bm\ scans, which in turn fixes the noise variance, and the
%filtering due to the data processing. {\lp As discussed in
%Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}, the latter is actually targeted to the analysis of
%point-like or compact sources that are largely encompassed
%within a $180''$-radius.}


{\rev The main beam solid angle is evaluated from the main beam (mb) FWHM, as
$\Omega_{\rm{mb}} = 2 \pi\,  \sigma_{\rm{mb}}^2$, where
FWHM$ =2\sqrt{2\ln{2}}\, \sigma_{\rm{mb}}$. The main beam efficiency
\begin{equation}
\rm{BE} = \frac{\Omega_{\rm{mb}}}{\Omega_{\rm{tot}}}
\end{equation}
is evaluated using both the {\tt UN75} and the {\tt BM12} data sets,
as presented in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_dataset}.} For cross-checks, we
compare the results based on three estimates of the total beam and
main beam solid angles:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{{\tt BE1} relies on the best-fitting parameters of the
    three-Gaussian model of the full beam, as given in
    Eq.~\ref{eq:3gauss}, to derive both the main beam solid angle and
    the two first errors beam contributions to the total beam solid
    angle. The main beam solid angle thus corresponds to the volume
    enclosed by the first Gaussian, as obtained using {\tt Prof-3G},
    while the normalised beam profile in Eq.~\ref{eq:omega_tot} is the
    normalised best-fitting $B_{3G}(r)$;}
  \item{{\tt BE2} consists in using the normalised beam profile
    measurements from the {\tt UN75} data set to estimate
    $\Omega_{\rm{tot}}$, while $\Omega_{\rm{mb}}$ is
    derived with the FWHM obtained using {\tt Prof-1G} (see
    Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_methods});}
  \item{{\tt BE3} is similar to {\tt BE2} but relies on the {\tt BM12}
    data set, while the main beam FWHM is derived using {\tt Map-1G}.}  
\end{itemize}
For all methods, the contributions of the third and fourth error beams
and of the far side lobes, which enters in Eq.~\ref{eq:omega_tot}, are
the same. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The main beam efficiency estimates using the three methods are gathered
in Table~\ref{tab:beam_efficiency}: central values and error
bars are evaluated as the median and the rms error of the
estimates on individual observation scans, respectively. 
{\rev We combined the results of the three methods, which are in
agreement with each others, using an inverse variance-weighted
average and a quadratic mean of the rms uncertainties. 
%The rms uncertainties are conservatively
%computed using the maximum half-difference measurements.
The main beam efficiency uncertainties, as given in
Table~\ref{tab:beam_efficiency}, also include uncertainties on the
third and fourth error beam contributions and on the \trentemetre\
telescope forward efficiencies, as reported
in \citet{Greve1998, Kramer2013}.}
Using the combined results, we report main beam efficiencies of
{\rev $47 \pm 3 \%$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and  $64 \pm 3 \%$ at $2\,\rm{mm}$.}
%{\lp Using IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope EMIR frontend
%observations~\citep{Carter2012}, \citet{Kramer2013} found main
%beam efficiency of $59\%$ at $230\,\rm{GHz}$ and of $74\%$ at
%$145\,\rm{GHz}$ accounting for the beam solid angle stemming from
%radii greater than $180''$. Having slightly lower main beam

%Heterodyne observations at the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope
%towards the lunar edge and the measure of forward beam efficiency using
%skydips show that a non negligible fraction of the full beam stems
%from radius greater than $180''$~\citep{Greve1998, Kramer2013}.
%An accurate evaluation of the total beam solid angle using NIKA2 would require
%{\lp the development of a dedicated data reduction method tailored to
%handled very extended diffuse emission,} as well as a 
%dedicated observation program~\citep{Greve1998, Sugimoto2004, Gusten2006}.
%{\lp Here we use the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope beam model described
%in \citet{Kramer2013} to evaluate the beam solid angle stemming from a
%radius greater than $180''$.
%This quantity receives two contributions, the one of the error beams,
%which are modeled as three Gaussians, and the one of the forward and
%rearward spillover and scattering efficiencies. We compute the solid
%angle of the main beam and error beams integrated over a radius ranging
%from $180''$ to $390''$, which is the maximum radius covered by \bm\ scan,
%$\Omega_{180<r<390}^{\rm{mb+eb}}$, and over radii greater
%than $180''$, $\Omega_{>180}^{\rm{mb+eb}}$. We use NIKA2 main beam as
%measured in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam} and the three-Gaussian error beams
%as reported in \citet{Kramer2013}.

{\rev Finally, we compute the total beam solid angle and main beam
efficiency using the combination of the three previously described
methods, in three cases that successively include larger angular scale
contributions to the full beam: $\Omega_{90}$ and $\rm{BE}_{90}$ are
the total beam solid angle and main beam efficiency integrated up to
$90''$, which include the main beam and the two lower angular scales
error beams, as measured in NIKA2 beam maps; $\Omega_{\rm{hyb}}$ and
$\rm{BE}_{\rm{hyb}}$ further account for the third and fourth error
beams, as derived from EMIR front-end measurements; $\Omega_{\rm{tot}}$
and $\rm{BE}$ are the final estimates that comprise all beam
contributions. The results are given in Table~\ref{tab:solid_corr} for
the 1\,mm and 2\,mm channels. These give insight on the relative
importance of the contributions at various angular scales. For
example, 18$\%$ and 13$\%$ of the total beam solid angle stem mainly
from the two largest error beams integrated at angular
scales larger than 90'', and 9$\%$ and 7$\%$ originate from the far
side lobes at 1 and 2\,mm respectively.}




%The results are given in
%Table~\ref{tab:solid_corr}, as well as the contribution to the beam
%solid angle of the forward and rearward spillover and scattering
%efficiencies, $\Omega^{\rm{frss}}$. The total beam solid angle 
%$\Omega_{\rm{tot}}$ can be estimated as
%\begin{equation}
%\Omega_{\rm{tot}} = \Omega_{180} + \Omega_{>180}^{\rm{mb+eb}}
%+ \Omega^{\rm{frss}}.
%\label{eq:omega_beam_4pi}
%\end{equation}

%{\lp These results are useful to study very extended diffuse sources or to perform
%aperture photometry up to radii larger than 180'', as will be
%discussed below in Sect.~\ref{se:extended_source_calib}.}
