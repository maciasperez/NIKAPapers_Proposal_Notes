\abstract{The detection of the primordial B-modes constitutes one of the major challenges of modern cosmology. The precise measurement of this signal requires an accurate determination of foreground contaminants and the absolute calibration of the instrument in terms of cross polarization and absolute polarization angle reconstruction.  We  present here a study of the well known polarization angle calibration source: the Crab nebula. It represents the most intense source in the microwave sky with an extension of few arcminutes corresponding to the typical beam of CMB experiments. The Crab nebula exhibits a highly polarized synchrotron radiation at radio and millimeter wavelengths.
In this paper we present Crab Stokes $I$, $Q$ and $U$ maps obtained at 150 GHz with the \NIKA\ camera. 
\NIKA\ has been operated at IRAM 30 m telescope from 2012 to 2015. It is a camera made of Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs) and observing the sky at 150 and 260 GHz. 
Taking advantage from previous observations of the Crab Nebula in intensity and polarization, we report in this paper the polarization spectral energy distribution (SED). }

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies offers a powerful way to investigate the early Universe. They can be decomposed into a scalar and a pseudo-scalar field, respectively called $E$  and $B$ modes. The primordial density fluctuations (scalar perturbations) can only produce $E$ CMB polarization, while $B$ CMB polarization can only be produced by 
primordial (tensor perturbations) gravitational waves \citep{polnarev1985polarization, 1997PhRvL..78.2054S} arising from the inflationary epoch \citep{PhysRevD.23.347, linde1982new} and by gravitational lensing of the $E-$modes \citep{ade2015planck}.
The detection of the primordial $B-$modes could definitively probe the existence of an inflationary epoch and constitutes one of the most ambitious goals of the modern observational cosmology.

Recently, \citet{bicepplanck2015,bicep2016} set a 95\% upper limit for the detection of the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ $\textless$ 0.07.
Upcoming CMB experiments aiming at measuring the primordial $B-$modes require an accurate determination of the foreground emissions to the CMB signal and a high control of the systematic effects. One of the most difficult parameters to be characterized for a CMB polarization experiment is the calibration of residual cross polarization and of the absolute polarization angle. This can be achieved using observations of well known polarized sources like the Crab nebula.

The Crab Nebula (or Tau A) located at equatorial coordinates $\alpha = 5^h34^m32s$ and $\beta = 22^{\circ}0^{\prime}52^{\prime\prime}$ is a plerion-type supernova remnant emitting a highly polarized signal.
A synchrotron emission from the nebula is observed in the radio frequency domain, which is powered by a pulsar through its jet. 
Moreover, near the center of the nebula we observe a shock, which is formed where the jet is thermalized and ultra-relativistic particles are released into the surrounding nebula. This source represents the most intense polarized astrophysical object in the microwave sky at angular scales of few arcminutes and for this reason it is of particularly interest  for the calibration of a CMB polarization experiment, which has a typically beam comparable to the extension of the source.
For a detailed review on this source we refer to \citet{2008ARA&A..46..127H}.

The Crab nebula has been already used for polarization cross-check analysis in the frequency range from 30 to 353 GHz of the \Planck\ satellite mission. High angular resolution observations achieved by the XPOL experiment \citep{thum2008} from the IRAM 30 m telescope have shown the spatial distribution of the Crab Nebula in intensity and polarization at 90 GHz with an absolute accuracy of 0.5$^{\circ}$ in the polarization angle \citep{aumont2010}. 
High angular resolution observations of the Crab nebula in polarization could be very useful for the calibration of the next generation of polarization experiments. In particular those aiming at a precise measurement of the CMB polarization, which have a large frequency range to be able to carefully study the foreground emissions. 

Previous studies \citep{macias2010} of the total flux density of the Crab nebula have shown a spectrum well described by a single synchrotron component, and predict negligible variations in polarization fraction and angle in the frequency of interest for CMB studies.
 
Polarized observations of the Crab Nebula have been performed with the \NIKA\ camera from the IRAM 30 m telescope during the observational campaign of February, 2015. A first report on this source has been discussed in \citep{2016JLTP..184..724R}.
In order to trace the polarized Spectral Energy Density (SED) we used polarization observations performed by the WMAP satellite at 23, 33, 41, 61 and 94 GHz \citep{2011ApJS..192...19W}, \Planck\ satellite at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143, 217, 353 GHz and XPOL at 90 GHz \citep{aumont2010}. 
 The paper is organized as follows: in Sec.~\ref{sec:NIKA observations} the intensity and polarization maps performed with the \NIKA\ camera
 are presented together with the polarization degree and angle spatial distribution; Sec.~\ref{sec:Polarization estimates in CMB experiments like beams} presents the reconstruction of the polarization properties in well defined regions to for comparison with CMB like beams experiments; Sec.~\ref{sec:Polarization intensity Spectral Energy Density (SED)} presents the Crab nebula SED; Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusions} we draw the conclusions.

\section{\NIKA\ observations of the Crab Nebula}\label{sec:NIKA observations}
\subsection{\NIKA\ camera}\label{sec:nika camera}
\NIKA\ is a dual band camera observing the sky at 150 and 260 GHz with 18$^{\prime\prime}$ and 12$^{\prime\prime}$ FWHM resolution, respectively. It has been operated at the IRAM 30 telescope between 2012-2015. A detailed description of the \NIKA\ camera can be found in \citet{monfardini2010, monfardini2011, catalano2014}. In addition to the measurements in intensity it was also a test bench for polarization facilities of the final instrument \NIKAd, installed at the telescope on October, 2015 \citep{calvo2016,2016arXiv160508628C}.
 A previous paper \citep{ritacco2017} gives more details on \NIKA\ polarization facilities and it describes the performances of the instrument at the telescope. The characterization of the \NIKA\ polarization capabilities has been very important to get prepared for the follow-up camera \NIKAd. Beyond that, \NIKA\ provided the first polarization observations performed with KIDs. Unfortunately, the observations of the Crab nebula performed at 260 GHz have been limited by the sensitivity of the \NIKA\ instrument in polarization and the resulting maps show a no significant detection, for that reason here we discuss only the observations performed at 150 GHz. 

\subsection{\NIKA\ observations}\label{sec:nika_observations}
In order to obtain polarization maps a dedicated data analysis pipeline has been developed and described in \citet{ritacco2017}. 
The Stokes $I$, $Q$ and, $U$ maps shown in Fig.~\ref{crab_intensity_maps} have been obtained by a combination of 16 observational scans of 8 $\times$ 6 arcminutes for a total observation time of $\sim$ 2.7 hours performed during the observational campaign of February 2015. In order to have the best coverage of the source surface we performed on-the-fly maps oriented in equatorial coordinates according to four different scan directions: 0$^{\circ}$, 90$^{\circ}$, 120$^{\circ}$, 150$^{\circ}$. 
For an extended source like the Crab nebula, with angular size bigger than \NIKA\ beams, it is difficult to properly estimate its intensity emission avoiding filtering effects due to noise decorrelation methods. The ``classical'' common mode decorrelation method used consists on the use of only the pixels outside the source to reconstruct the template to be subtracted. Filtering effects can be encountered in regions where the number of pixels used for the decorrelation is too low.
This occurs observing sources more extended than the beam of the instrument, like the Crab nebula. 
In order to avoid such an effect the Stokes $I$ map shown on the left panel of Fig.~\ref{crab_intensity_maps} has been obtained by using a decorrelation method called ``dual-band decorrelation''. Such a decorrelation algorithm has been developed for the reconstruction of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal in galaxy clusters observations \citep{adam2013} taking advantage of \NIKA\ dual-band capabilities. The idea of this algorithm arises with the fact that the atmospheric emission is stronger at 260 GHz than at 150 GHz, as a consequence we can use 260 GHz observations as a ``template'' to be subtracted to the 150 GHz observational data.
 
Further, we identified an intensity to polarization leakage effect observing Uranus, which is expected to be unpolarized. In order to correct for this effect an algorithm has been developed and applied to all the \NIKA\ observations performed in polarization. This effect together with the leakage correction algorithm is well described in \citet{ritacco2017}. 

The observed signal reaches a value of 0.5\% peak-to-peak of the total intensity. The level of this spurious instrumental polarization is significantly lower than the observed one on Uranus. This is probably due to a compensation of the negative and positive signal between adjacent pixels. Although the leakage effect is very weak on this diffuse source the correction is still applied to produce the final maps presented in Fig.~\ref{crab_intensity_maps}.


%This data analysis allows to produce Stokes $I$, $Q$ and $U$ maps as shown in Figg.~\ref{crab_intensity_maps},\ref{crab_polarization_maps}. The continuos rotation of the HWP running at 2.98 Hz permits to shift the polarized signal at higher frequencies. In this way the polarized signal is cleaned by the low frequency noise (e.g.~atmosphere variations, electronics etc), but the intensity signal could be. As a consequence an accurate determination of the polarization fraction requires a good estimation of the total intensity map. 

%Fig.~\ref{crab_intensity_maps} shows the Stokes intensity map obtained at 150 GHz using the dual band decorrelation method.


%For illustration we show in Fig.~\ref{fig:crab_leakage_maps} the intensity to polarization leakage maps of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ of the Crab nebula, obtained as subtraction of the $Q$ and $U$ maps before and after leakage correction.

%The intensity to polarization leakage peak-to-peak reaches a value of $\sim$ 1\% (260 GHz) and 0.5\% (150 GHz) of the total intensity, see Fig.~\ref{fig:crab_leakage_maps}. 

\subsection{Crab polarization properties}\label{sec:pol_properties}
In this section we discuss the polarization properties of the source in terms of polarization degree $p$ and angle $\psi$, which are defined through the Stokes parameters $I, Q$, and $U$ as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
 p    &=& \frac{\sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}}{I} \nonumber \\
 \psi &=& \frac{1}{2}\arctan\frac{U}{Q}.\label{angledegree_polar}
 \end{eqnarray}
 These definitions are not linear in $I$, $Q$ and $U$ and are biased by the noise. Where the signal-to-noise ratio is too low ($\it{i.e.}$ $ Q \simeq U \simeq 0$)  the noise measured on $Q$ and $U$ maps will yield a non-zero degree of the polarization estimate.
\citet{1980A&A....91...97S,1985A&A...142..100S,montier} proposed analytical solutions to correct this bias. However, at the limit of high S/N ratio which the estimation of the polarization degree and its uncertainty become:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 p    &=& \frac{\sqrt{Q^2 + U^2 - \sigma_{Q}^2 - \sigma_{U}^2}}{I}, \nonumber \\ 
  \sigma_{p} &=& \frac{\sqrt{Q^2\sigma_Q^2 + U^2\sigma_U^2 + p^4I^2\sigma_I^2}}{pI^2}.
  \label{p_true_degree}
 \end{eqnarray}
 Furthermore, the polarization angle in a high S/N regime can be approximated by the classical Eq.~\ref{angledegree_polar} with uncertainty
  \begin{eqnarray}\label{angle_uncertainty}
  \sigma_{\psi} = \frac{\sqrt{Q^2\sigma_Q^2 + U^2\sigma_u^2}}{2(pI)^2}.
  \end{eqnarray}
  
For the representation of the polarization degree and angle maps (left panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:pol_degree}) we keep the standard representation (see Eq.~\ref{angledegree_polar}) to ease the comparison with other experiments, which usually adopt this convention. This choice is however a valid approximation because of the high signal to noise ratio observed on the maps. By contrast, the right panels show the debiased (see Eq.~\ref{p_true_degree}) values of polarization degree and angle as function of the Stokes intensity $I$ map, where the polarization intensity P=$\sqrt{Q^2+U^2}$  $\textgreater$ 5 $\sigma_P$. 
The distribution of the polarization degree in Fig.~\ref{fig:pol_degree} appears highly dispersed around a polarization degree value of $\sim$ 20-30$\pm$4\%.

%\label{fig:pol_angle}
%\end{figure*}
The spatial distribution of $\psi$ presented on the bottom right panel of the figure shows a value of the angle $\simeq$ 150$^{\circ}$ represented here in equatorial coordinates, which remains approximately constant in the central region of the source. On the map edges, $\psi$ pixel-to-pixel deviation is high, except for the northern region where the average angle is around $220^{\circ}$. This particular effect has been already observed by the XPOL experiment at 90 GHz \citep{aumont2010}.
This together with the variation of the polarization fraction and angle observed confirms the need of high angular resolution observations at low and high frequencies for a good understanding of the source polarized emission.

The polarization intensity $P$ is also represented in Fig.~\ref{crab_ipol_maps}. We can clearly identify the high polarization emission located near the pulsar position and the surrounding gas. 

\section{Total intensity and polarization in well defined regions}\label{sec:Polarization estimates in CMB experiments like beams}
The angular extension of the Crab nebula is 4$^{\prime}$. In order to have an estimation of the flux in this region we calculate the integrated flux as shown in Fig.~\ref{crab_integrated_flux}. A zero level, calculated as the mean of the signal measured on an external annular ring region, has been subtracted from the flux. The maximum signal estimated in this region is 204.4$\pm$7.9$\pm$10.2 Jy. The first uncertainty accounts for statistical uncertainties computed from fluctuations of the signal at large radii. The second term of the uncertainty indicates the calibration error corresponding to  $\simeq$ 5\% at 150 GHz. This absolute error is estimated as the dispersion of all the Uranus observations collected during the observational campaign.

\begin{figure}[h!]

     { \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{figures/Crab_integrated_flux_2mm.pdf}}

\label{crab_integrated_flux}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Polarization estimates in CMB experiments like beams}
In order to compare with low angular resolution CMB experiments we give here the polarization degree $p$ and angle $\psi$ integrated values obtained in well defined regions. 
Tab.~\ref{tab:crab_results} shows the total intensity $I$, polarized intensity $P$, polarization degree $p$ and polarization angle $\psi$ obtained in four different regions. In order to compare with \Planck\ satellite we estimate the values in two regions of $7^{\prime}$ and $5^{\prime}$ corresponding to the beams of the \Planck\ frequency channels at 143 and 217 GHz, respectively. 
Further, two regions are defined with high S/N ratio. First, where $P$ $\textgreater$ $3\sigma$ and then, referring to the polarization intensity $P$ (see Fig.~\ref{crab_ipol_maps}) around the peak of the signal where $P$ $\textgreater$ 0.2 Jy. 
In Tab.~\ref{tab:crab_results} the polarization angles are represented in Galactic coordinates to ease the comparison with \Planck\ \citep{2015arXiv150702058P} and \WMAP\ CMB experiments \citep{2011ApJS..192...19W}. 
The difference between the polarization angles found can be explained by the fact that we account for low S/N regions in the estimation of the Stokes $I$, $Q$ and, $U$ fluxes. For the comparison with other instruments we choose the polarization angle estimated in 5$^{\prime}$ and where $P$ $\textgreater$ 3$\sigma$ as best estimator. This latter is represented in red in Fig.~\ref{crab_p_angle_comparison}, the uncertainty accounts for statistical estimation and the systematic uncertainty of 1.8$^\circ$. It is furthermore in a very good agreement with the result found by \Planck\ at 143 GHz and it is in agreement at 1$\sigma$ with all the observations.

Fig.~\ref{crab_p_angle_comparison} shows the polarization fraction (top) and angle (bottom) as function of the frequency for five different instruments: \Planck, WMAP, XPOL, SCUPOL and \NIKA. Notice that SCUPOL maps \citep{scubapol} provided at 352 GHz have reduced angular size w.r.t \NIKA. For that reason we define a small region of 1.4$^\prime$ around the peak of the polarization intensity. 
For the polarization fraction we keep the convention used by XPOL \citep{aumont2010} and we represent in the figure the value measured in 5$^{\prime}$. 
The solid line in both figures represents the mean value found using all the observations shown and the uncertainty represents the standard deviation.

\NIKA\ and XPOL polarization fraction estimates are not consistent. This can be explained by the difference observed in the estimation of total intensity for both instruments. A lower total intensity measured produces a higher polarization degree. Notice that by referring to Fig.~\ref{crab_SED} the value obtained by \NIKA\ at 150 GHz appears well consistent with previous experiments, whereas XPOL intensity is a bit low with respect to what expected by power law estimated by \citep{macias2010} and the best-fit model estimated in this paper.

\section{Crab SED}\label{sec:Polarization intensity Spectral Energy Density (SED)}
\subsection{Intensity}
As previously stated observing the Crab nebula is particularly interesting for its angular extension, which is compatible with the typical beam of a CMB experiment, and for its stability across the millimeter wavelengths range. 
Its total intensity emission at millimeter wavelengths (1 and $10^6$ GHz) is well described by a synchrotron spectrum decreasing with the frequency, which has the form:
\begin{equation}
I_{\nu} = A(\nu / 1 GHz)^{\beta}
\end{equation}\label{eq:sync}
 with spectral index $\beta$ = -0.296$\pm$0.06 \citep{baars1977absolute,macias2010}. At submillimeter wavelengths (10-100 $\mu$m) a cold dust component is also observed. Further, the Crab nebula is fading with time at a rate of $\alpha$ = 0.167$\pm$0.015 \% yr$^{-1}$ \citep{aller1985decrease}. 
These observations suggest a low frequency emission produced by particles accelerated by the same magnetic field. The direction of the polarization is thus expected to be constant while the polarization degree may vary. 

In order to compare the \NIKA\ results with previous analysis we represent in Fig.~\ref{crab_SED} the intensity flux of the Crab nebula as a function of the frequency. The ``radio experiments''  in the plot refer to values reported in \citep{dmitrenko1970absolute,1971IzVUZ..14..157V}. We also include \Archeops\ \citep{macias2007archeops}, \Planck\ \citep{2015arXiv150702058P}, WMAP \citep{2011ApJS..192...19W} and MAMBO \citep{2002A&A...386.1044B}. \NIKA\ intensity flux obtained at 150 GHz is shown in red.
The fit model obtained by a previous analysis \citep{macias2010} is shown in green. The coefficients of best-fit model (cyan) is obtained by $\chi^2$ minimization for observations at $\nu$ $\textless$100 GHz are:
\begin{equation}
 A = 980.6 \pm 0.7  ,\quad \beta = -0.3151 \pm 0.0002. 
 \end{equation}
 Notice that fading is accounted for in the best-fit estimation as well as in the data represented in figure, to ease the interpretation of the plot.
 The \Planck\ measurements obtained at 100, 143, 217 and 353 GHz suggest an another power law component in the Crab, unexpected at these frequencies, maybe due to the contribution of another population of electrons, which produce a sweeping change in the spectrum at the knee frequency of 90 GHz. The coefficients of the fit in the frequency range 100 $\textless$ $\nu$ $\textless$ 360 GHz are: A = 8.6 $\pm$ 0.45 and $\beta$ = -0.71 $\pm$ 0.09. By contrast high angular resolution results provided by \NIKA\ and MAMBO at 230 GHz are in contrast with this behaviour at higher frequency than 100 GHz. Further high angular resolution observations in this frequency range could provide a better understanding of the emission spectrum. 

The estimated best-fit model (cyan line) is a bit different w.r.t the previous analysis provided by \citep{macias2010} mainly because of the addition of recently published results by \Planck\ \citep{2015arXiv150702058P} and  WMAP \citep{2011ApJS..192...19W}. However, the result found at 150 GHz by the \NIKA\ camera agrees in 1 $\sigma$ uncertainty both models. It is also in agreement within 2 $\sigma$ with the estimated fit at higher frequencies found using \Planck\ observations.

\subsection{Polarization}
The total intensity of the Crab nebula has been monitored along decades across a large range of frequency but the polarization amount of observations is really poor.
The recent results provided by \Planck\ \citep{2015arXiv150702058P}, \WMAP\ \citep{2011ApJS..192...19W}, XPOL \citep{aumont2010} allow together with \NIKA\ to trace the polarization intensity SED, see Fig.~\ref{crab_SED_ipol}. The different values measured by \Planck\ are quite different between each other, while the \WMAP\ results are consistent with a power law decreasing with the frequency. 
Assuming a power law as described by the Eq.~\ref{eq:sync} we estimate two models represented in blue and black on the figure account for only \WMAP\ data and \Planck\ data, respectively.
Accounting for fading the fitted amplitude and spectral indexes $\beta$ are:
\begin{itemize}
\item fit results using only the WMAP data:
\begin{equation}
A = 78.9\pm7.8 \quad , \quad \beta_p = -0.35\pm0.03;
\end{equation}
\item fit results using only the \Planck\ data:
\begin{equation}
A = 179.1\pm15.4 \quad , \quad \beta_p = -0.54\pm0.02.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
The ``\WMAP'' fit is generally consistent with itself and with \Planck\ observations at 30, 100 and 353 GHz. \NIKA\ result obtained at 150 GHz is well consistent with this model and also consistent in 1$\sigma$ with the ``\Planck\'' fit. By contrast, the \Planck\ data have a significantly steeper spectral index. This model is not consistent neither with the \Planck\ observation at 70 and 353 GHz nor with the \WMAP\ observations except for the point at 61 GHz.

As already discussed above, the controversial interpretation of these two models confirm the need of new mm wavelengths polarization observations.
Moreover, we take advantage from previous observations performed by SCUPOL at 352 GHz (850 $\mu$m) to estimate the spectral index $\beta_p$ = -0.33 $\pm$ 0.01. This latter is in a very good agreement with the estimation of the spectral index using the SED and the model derived using WMAP observations. 

%The left panel of Fig.~\ref{crab_beta_ipol} represents the spatial distribution of the spectral index $\beta$ where $I$ $\textgreater$ 3$\sigma$. $\beta$ is obtained as described by the Eq.~\ref{beta_equation} considering the \NIKA\ Stokes $I$ maps of Fig.~\ref{crab_intensity_maps} and accounting for the corresponding frequencies. 

%The right panel of Fig.~\ref{crab_beta_ipol} shows the total intensity map values at 260 GHz as function of the total intensity map observed at 150 GHz. The correlation found between the two frequencies suggests the same physical origin of the emission. 
%The value of the spectral index obtained by the fit is:
%\begin{equation}
%\beta = -0.482 \pm 0.002.
%\end{equation}
%The measured value is different from the expected spectral index from previous observation \citet{baars1977absolute,macias2010}. This difference can be explained by the noise decorrelation used, which is different for the two Stokes $I$ map estimation, that causes filtering effect on the map at 260 GHz.
%The measured spectral index is in agreement with what we observe on the map of the spatial distribution of $\beta$. Indeed, $\beta$ remains approximately constant around -0.45 in the most intense emission region of the source. The contours (red) represent the 150 GHz Stokes $I$ emission map.

%In polarization the low S/N observed at 260 GHz prevents us to have a significant detection and to derive the spatial distribution of the spectral index.



\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
This paper presents the Crab nebula polarization observations performed at 150 GHz by the \NIKA\ camera. Such high angular resolution observations allows to trace the spatial distribution of the polarization fraction and angle. 
We also estimate the polarization proprieties in well defined regions on the source, allowing the comparison with CMB experiments, which have a typical beam of $5^\prime$. The value that we assume as best estimator of the polarization angle is -87.15$\pm$0.04$\pm$1.8. We found generally a consistency with \Planck, \WMAP\ and XPOL previous observations. The polarization degree is also consistent and vary depending on the region considered as expected. 
We present here also the first estimation of the Crab polarization intensity SED. Taking advantage from previous observations of \WMAP\ and assuming a synchrotron like power law we estimate the best-fit model with coefficients: A = 78.9$\pm$7.8  $\beta_p$ = -0.35$\pm$0.03. \NIKA\ polarization intensity result is a very good agreement with this model. The estimation of the spectral index using SCUPOL observation at 352 GHz and \NIKA\ at 150 GHz gives $\beta_p$ = -0.33$\pm$0.01, confirming the result found previously on the SED.
From the analysis presented here we clearly need more polarization high angular resolution observations in the frequency range from 100 to 500 GHz to better understand the discrepancy found between, for example, \Planck\ results in total intensity and polarization with other observations.
