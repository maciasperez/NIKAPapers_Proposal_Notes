The measurement of CMB polarization, and especially the detection of $B$ modes, is
one of the major challenges in modern cosmology. In fact, a key motivation for
CMB polarization measurements is the theory of cosmic inflation. $B$ modes can be
generated by two mechanisms : gravitational lensing of $E$ modes
\citep{2013PhRvL.111n1301H}, or by gravitational waves produced during
inflation. The detection of primordial B modes would represent an indirect
detection of primordial gravitational waves, and as a result, establish the
theory of cosmic inflation.\\ In order to detect B modes, we need to study the
universe at high sensitivity. To do so, the development of
large detectors arrays is required.  The most used kind of detectors are
bolometers named Transition Edge Sensors (TES), but now their performances are
limited by the photon noise. It is possible to do medium-sized arrays of TES
detectors (1000 pixels), but developing larger arrays gets complicated for
technical and economical reasons. Other detectors used are Cold Electron
Bolometer (CEB) \citep{2007stt..conf...93K} and Superconducting Tunnel Junctions
(STJ) but they face difficulties in the fabrication process making them not
suitable for large arrays. Bolometers have enjoyed considerable technical
improvements but further array scaling is strongly limited by the multiplexing
factor of the readout electronics, consequently it was necessary to develop
detectors adapted to strong frequency domain multiplexing.\\ In this context, a
new kind of detectors was developed : the Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs),
proposed by \citet{2003Natur.425..817D}. Since 2007, these detectors have been
developed for the construction of NIKA2 and its prototype NIKA (New IRAM Kids
Arrays), which is the first operational instrument using KIDs
\citep{2010A&A...521A..29M,2016JLTP..184..816C}. The main characteristic that
makes KIDs one of the best candidates to large size detector array is their
natural multiplexing capability. Indeed, the resonant frequencies of a resonator
can be easily controlled during the array design, and the sharpness of the
resonances allows many resonators to be placed into a limited band-width. Thus,
a large number of resonators, can be coupled to a single transmission line, each
one resonating at a different frequency $f_{0}^{i}$ \citep{2010A&A...521A..29M,
  Calvo2008}.\\ Together with high sensitivity, a strict control of systematic effects must be achieved. In fact, due to its faintness, The B-mode polarization can be easily degraded by various systematic
effects and it is important to remove these spurious contributions. Some of
these effects can be reduced in the design of the instruments while others have
to be simulated and corrected a posteriori. Numerous systematic effects arise
from optical and instrumental imperfections, temperature drifts of the optics
and detectors, contaminations by astrophysical foregrounds and te detector
non-linearity. These effects can be modelled and characterized by the spurious
signal $C_{l}$ they produce. For more details see \citep{2008PhRvD..77h3003S,
  quickpol} and references therein.\\ KIDs are a new technology that are now
routinely used in ground-based telescopes. However, in view of futur
uses above the atmosphere, we still have to demonstrate their
compatibility with a space mission (such as COrE \citep{2016arXiv160907263D}),
hence the need to master their sytematic effects. In this paper, we adress a few
specific systematics to KIDs. The paper is organized as follows:

\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

This paper presents the study of KIDs systematic effects such as the non-linearity and an application to the CMB polarization. 
KIDs are a new kind of detectors based on superconducting technology that provides high sensitivity. They have been developed for the construction of NIKA and NIKA2 since 2007, which is now the first operational instrument using KIDs. One of the key asset of KIDs is their natural multiplexing capability which makes them one of the best candidates for future space mission that needs large size detector array. In this context, in a first part, we studied the response of a KID by using two methods to reconstruct the signal (\rf and \cf) and its systematic effects caracterized by its non-linearity coefficient \eps. For an incoming source consisting of a planet of 500 Jy, the dipole and a HWP, and for different scan speed, we found $\varepsilon_{rf}$ $\simeq 10^{-5}$ and $\varepsilon_{cf}$ $\simeq 10^{-7}$. The non-linearity depends on the way that we reconstruct the signal, and even if \rf can reconstruct the signal very well, \cf is better at it and generates less non-linearities. Another good point is that the modulation of the HWP does not bias the measurement by inducing large non-linearities. We have seen that in order to have less non-linearities, we need to put constraints on the scanning speed, so in a second part, we did more realistic simulations, by scanning a map of the Galaxy and dipole by using satellite pointing strategies. We found, that depending on the incoming sources, $\varepsilon_{rf}$ varies between $10^{-7}$ (Galaxy only) and $10^{-3}$ (Galaxy, dipole, HWP), and $\varepsilon_{cf}$ varies between $10^{-8}$ (Galaxy only) and $10^{-4}$ (Galaxy, dipole, HWP) (POLSAT, VOIR PB PLANCK). The results show that in a space context KIDs are capable of accurately reproducing the signal and that as in the precedent simulations \cf is slightly better than \rf.\\
The measure of CMB $B$ modes polarization is a major goal of observational cosmology, as their detection would sign the presence of primordial gravitational waves and provide a confirmation of inflation. Observations of CMB polarization demand a high control of systematics effect and in light of this, we demonstrated the capabilities of KIDs arrays to detect B modes polarization by comparing systematic effects coming from the detector and the leakage of dust temperature into polarization maps. With HEALPix, we simulated spurious signals from a map of the Galaxy and generated modified $C_{l}$. From $C_{l}^{TE}$, we calculated the coefficient ($\varepsilon'$) related to the leakage of temperature into polarization. For a tensor-to-scalar ratio (T/S) = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 we respectively found $\varepsilon' \simeq 2.51$x$10^{-2}$, 7.95x$10^{-3}$, 2.51x$10^{-3}$. Because the leakage of temperature into polarization maps is the systematic effect that is most likely to contaminate the detection of $B$ modes , to be able to measure them, the non-linear coefficient $\varepsilon$ related to the detector must be lower than $\varepsilon'$. In all of the precedent simulations, $\varepsilon $ varried between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-8}$, so $\varepsilon < \varepsilon'$, therefore we can say that the KID is capable of detecting $B$ mode polarization. Finally, because of the KID multiplexing ability and its capability of detecting $B$ mode polarization, we can say that KID technology is developping toward becoming one of the best candidates to space mission and study of the CMB polarization.
