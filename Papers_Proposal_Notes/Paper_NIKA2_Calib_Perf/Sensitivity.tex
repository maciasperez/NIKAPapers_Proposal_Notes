%\section{Sensitivity}
%\label{se:sensitivity}
%\input{Sensitivity.tex}

In this section, we derive the on-sky sensitivity of the instrument
using a large amount of observation scans, including deep integration
on faint sources, to assess our result stability against the observing
conditions. We evaluate the noise equivalent flux
density, NEFD hereafter, that is the flux density
$1\,\sigma$ errors in one second of effective
on-source telescope integration time after the baseline calibration
has been performed, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration}. The first step for
the NEFD measurement is thus an accurate evaluation of the on-source
integration time, which is addressed in
Sect.~\ref{se:integration_time}. Then, for robustness test of the NEFD
estimates, we have devised several methods for estimating the NEFD. A
detailed description of our methods, as well as an application to a
faint source blind detection, will be found in
\citet{Ponthieu2019}. In Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}, we briefly
present the NEFD estimation methods that have been used and the data
sets that have been selected. Finally, the NEFD estimates and the
results of the robustness tests we performed are reported in
Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_results}.


\subsection{Estimation of the time of integration}
\label{se:integration_time}

Considering an observation scan of a point-like source, from which we
produce a map by projecting the calibrated TOI (see
Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}) into pixels of size $\Delta r$, we primarily
estimate the time of integration on-source, which is the integration
time in a beam $t_{\rm{beam}}$, using
%
\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm{beam}} = \frac{<N_{\rm{hit}}>_{\rm{center}}}{f_{\rm{sam}}}\,
  \eta \frac{g^2}{\Delta_r^2},
  \label{eq:integration_time}
\end{equation}
%
where $N_{\rm{hit}}$ is the so-called hit map, that is the map of the
TOI sample count per map pixels, and $<N_{\rm{hit}}>_{\rm{center}}$
is the average of the hit map over the pixels within a FWHM radius
from the center of the map. The ratio of this quantity to the sampling
frequency $f_{\rm{sam}}$ thus corresponds to the total time of integration
spend in a map pixel of the center of the map. As all the KIDs of an
array produce a data sample at the same time, we need to correct the
total time of integration from the fraction of the KID that
contributes to a map pixel at the same time. For this purpose, first
we estimate the number of KID per map pixel as the ratio of $g^2$,
where $g$ is the distance between neighbour KIDs (see
Sect.~\ref{se:grid_distortion}), to $\Delta_r^2$. Then, we multiply
this quantity by the fraction of valid KID $\eta$ that actually
contribute to the map (see Sect.~\ref{se:avg_kidpar}). 

For cross-checks, we compare the $t_{\rm{beam}}$ estimates using an
alternative approach for evaluating the on-source integration
time based on geometrical considerations. Namely, we calculate the
fraction of the scanning time during which the point source in within
an effective FOV radius, which is defined as the FOV covered by the
valid KIDs. We find the two methods to give comparable integration
time estimates to better than $5\%$. We conclude the $t_{\rm{beam}}$
estimates to be reliable and use it for the NEFD derivation.  


\subsection{NEFD estimation methods}
\label{se:nefd_method}

We have devised three complementary methods for the
NEFD estimation, which come in two different flavours. First, we
use deep integrations on faint sources, and second we resort to 
joint analysis of multiple scans without combining them. An
extensive discussion of these methods will be given in
\citet{Ponthieu2019}. In this section, we briefly describe a single method
for the two different approaches: \\

\noindent \emph{Deep integration method:} The error on the flux of a point source for an
integration time $t$ is $\sigma_\phi(t) = NEFD/\sqrt{t}$. Co-adding several scans of
the same source and fitting $\sigma_\phi$ as a function of the
inverse of the square root of the
time of integration must therefore give a straight line whose
amplitude is the NEFD if correctly corrected for the different
elevation and opacity conditions of observations.\\

\noindent \emph{Scatter method:} Performing photometry on each
individual scan, we can estimate the sensitivity on the central flux
and measure the time of integration using
Eq.~\ref{eq:integration_time}, hence derive the NEFD for this
scan. After correction of the attenuation of the atmosphere, the joint
analysis of a series of scans provides us with an estimate of the
top-of-atmosphere NEFD. \\

The selection of the source target for the NEFD derivation is
primarily based on the flux density. Indeed, noise
characterization may be biased by residuals of a strong source and the
instrument far side lobes. For the scatter method, we therefore
restrict the analysis to sources with a flux below 1\,Jy. For the deep
integration method, we further need to select a single source whose
visibility allows for long integration time. During the N2R9 campaign,
we selected \hls\, which is a
moderately faint source \citep{hls_combes}, expected to be
74.5\,mJy at 1mm and 15.7\,mJy at 2mm (M.~Bethermin, private
communication). It has been observed for about 9\,h in total over
three nights using 8x5~arcmin$^2$ OTF scans of various orientations.

Combining the data set of N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14 campaigns,
more than one thousand observations scans of sub-Jy sources meet the
baseline selection criteria (see Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}),
providing us with robust NEFD estimates that are representative of
average NIKA2 performance, which are gathered in
Tab.~\ref{tab:nefd_astro}.
The top-of-atmosphere NEFD and RMS uncertainties are evaluated as the median and
the scatter of the individual NEFD corrected with
$\exp[\tau/sin(\delta)]$. These values are then extrapolated at the
reference IRAM observing conditions, which consists of $2~\rm{mm}$
of precipitable water vapor (pwv) in the atmosphere and $60$ degrees
elevation.


\subsubsection{Mapping speed}

To further estimate the mapping capabilities, we also evaluate the
mapping speed $M_{\rm{s}}$, which is defined as the sky area that is covered in one
hour of observation to a noise level of $1\,\rm{mJy}$, using
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm{s}} = \frac{\pi}{4} d_{\rm{FoV}}^2 \, \frac{\eta}{\rm{NEFD}^2},
\end{equation}
where $d_{\rm{FoV}} = 6.5'$ is the FoV diameter and $\eta$ the
fraction of valid KIDs, as given in Tab.~\ref{tab:number_of_kids} in
Sect.~\ref{se:fov_geometry}.
The mapping speed that is extrapolated at zero opacity, and the astronomer
mapping speed that is extrapolated at the reference IRAM observing conditions are
given in Tab.~\ref{tab:nefd_astro}.
