%\section{Calibration}
%\label{se:calibration}

%We present the calibration of the absolute scale of the flux densities
%for the NIKA2 instrument in this section using Uranus as the main
%primary calibrator. Practically, at the stage of the FOV
%reconstruction (see Sect.~\ref{se:geometry}), an absolute
%coefficient factor per detectors is derived using a \bm\ scan of
%Uranus. This step realizes also the inter-calibration of all the KID,
%as the coefficient factors give the KID gains. Secondly, the flux
%density absolute scale is further refined by monitoring the primary
%calibrator all along the observation campaign to estimate an
%absolute calibration correction.

%We have evidenced a daily variation of the absolute calibration
%coefficients as a function of the observation date, which is related
%to temperature-induced variation of the beam size. If left uncorrected, this variation
%induces a sizable increase of the calibration uncertainties. To
%overcome this issue, we primarily flag the most impacted observation
%dates and exclude the observations acquired during these periods. This
%conservative approach constitutes the baseline calibration method,
%which is further used for the performance assessment. For cross-check,
%we also proposed an alternative method relying on a photometric
%correction depending on the beam size. Both approaches require an
%accurate monitoring of the beam size as a function of the observation
%date.


%First we describe the method for the absolute calibration in
%Sect.~\ref{se:calibration_method}, then we present the
%inter-calibration and the flat fields in
%Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field}. The temperature-induced variation and the
%beam size monitoring are then discussed in
%Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}. Finally, the baseline calibration is
%presented in Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration} and the calibration
%with a photometric correction in
%Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_correction}.

\subsection{Baseline calibration}
\label{se:baseline_calibration}

To assess NIKA2 performance, we rely on a baseline calibration that
resorts to the following methods: i) the calibration in FWHM$_0$ Gaussian
as detailed in Sect.~\ref{se:calibration_method} is implemented, ii)
the temperature-induced variation effect is mitigated using the scan
selection described in Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection} and iii) the
atmospheric attenuation is corrected using the {\tt corrected skydip}
opacity derivation described in Sect.~\ref{se:corrected-skydip}.

Here we check the stability of Uranus flux density
estimates againts the beam size
(Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_scans}) and againts the
atmospheric transmission (Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_atm})
using the baseline calibration, 
and we compare to results based on other opacity correction methods
(Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_opacity}).

%In this section, we check the stability of Uranus flux density
%estimates againts the beam size in
%Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_scans} and againts the
%atmospheric transmission in
%Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_atm}. In
%Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_opacity}, we compare
%Uranus flux density estimates after absolute calibration using other
%opacity correction methods.

\subsubsection{Flux stability against the beam size}
\label{se:baseline_calibration_scans}
We present the Uranus measured-to-predicted flux density ratio as a
function of the 2D Gaussian FWHM estimates and color-coded from the
observation dates given in UT hours in
Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_all}.

\caption[Uranus flux density stability against FWHM]{ Uranus flux
density ratio vs beam size after baseline calibration. The ratio
of Uranus measured flux densities to expectations as a function of the
measured 2D Gaussian beam FWHM is shown for the $1$-mm array
combination (top panel) and for array 2 (bottom panel) after absolute calibration using the
baseline method. These plots include all Uranus scans acquired during the 
N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14 campaigns and whose beam FWHM are below the threshold indicated
by the vertical red lines (open circles), as well as the scans that
met the baseline selection criteria (filled circles).}
\label{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_all}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The flux density estimates have been calibrated beforehands, so that
the flux density ratios are equal to unity in average by construction.
The selected scan flux ratios (shown as full circles) are stable
against the beam FWHM. The baseline scan selection of
Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection} is thus efficient to mitigate the
temperature-induced beam variation effect.


\subsubsection{Flux stability against the atmospheric transmission}
\label{se:baseline_calibration_atm}

We test the stability of Uranus flux densities calibrated using the
baseline calibration against the atmospheric transmission. The later
depends on the measured zenith opacity $\tau$ and the scan
average airmass $x = $cosec$(\elev)$ as $\exp{(-\tau \cdot x)}$. In
the first row of Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_atmtrans}, Uranus flux ratio
is shown as a function of the atmospheric
transmission for the $1$-mm array combination and Array 2 and for the
three considered observation campaigns (N2R9, N2R12 $\&$ N2R14). We
observe no sizable correlation of the flux ratio with the atmospheric
transmission, which constitutes a first
indication of the robustness of the flux density estimates against the
atmospheric conditions using the baseline calibration. This will be
further tested using a larger number of scans in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.

\subsubsection{Comparison with other opacity correction methods}
\label{se:baseline_calibration_opacity}

For cross-check, we have derived the absolute
calibration factors using the {\tt taumeter}
(Sect.~\ref{se:taumeter-method}) and the {\tt skydip}
(Sect.~\ref{se:skydip-method}) atmospheric opacity
correction methods. We then compare Uranus
flux density estimates after absolute calibration using the baseline
calibration and these two alternative corrections. Figure~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_atmtrans}
shows the Uranus measured-to-modeled
flux ratio as a function of the atmospheric transmission for A1$\&$A3
and for A2 after the {\tt taumeter} correction (second row) and
after the {\tt skydip} correction (third row). We observe more
dispersion for the {\tt taumeter}-based flux ratio, whereas the {\tt
skydip}-based ratio is very similar as the baseline ratio except
for a slight decrease of the flux at low atmospheric
transmission. Thus the {\tt taumeter} and {\tt skydip} atmospheric
opacity correction methods can be used for
the absolute calibration in complement to {\tt corrected skydip}, e.g. to
perform robustness tests as in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.

%	PHOTOMETRIC CORRECTION
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Photometric correction}
\label{se:photometric_correction}

The baseline calibration (Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration}) relies
on the scan selection, as defined in Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}, to
mitigate the \afternoon\ beam size variations, which is discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}. By contrast, in this section, we
address the issue of calibrating even during the observing periods
impacted by the \afternoon\ beam variation effect. We discuss an
alternative calibration method that
relies on a photometric correction depending on the beam size. The
objective is both to cross-check the baseline calibration results
using more observation scans and to anticipate on future developments
that could be deployed if an accurate beam monitoring is performed.


\subsubsection{Photometric correction method}
\label{se:photometric_correction_method}

When the beam size broadens due to e.g. \afternoon\ beam effect, the
flux density is smeared in a larger solid angle and
the flux density estimator, which is based on the amplitude fit of a
Gaussian beam of fixed FWHM (see
Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}) is biased toward low flux
densities.

Considering only the main beam broadening, modeled as a Gaussian of
size $FWHM' = 2 \sqrt{2\ln{2}} \, \sigma '$, we show in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_correction_detail} that
the flux density estimator depends on the size of the convolution
function between the enlarged $\sigma '$-Gaussian, which can be
monitored as in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}, and the 
$\sigma_0$ fixed-width Gaussian of our reference system.

An unbiaised
flux density $\hat{S}_{\rm{pc}}$ can be derived from the flux density
estimate $\hat{S}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}_{\rm{pc}} = f(\sigma')\hat{S},
\end{equation}
where $f(\sigma')$ is a photometric correction of the beam variation
effect. Within the Gaussian model, it reads:
\begin{equation}
  f(\sigma') = \frac{(\sigma'^2 + \sigma_0^2)}{\sigma_{\star}^2 + \sigma_0^2}. 
\end{equation} 

The beam size in stable observing condition $\sigma_\star$ is
determined by measuring the 2D Gaussian beam on the series of scans of
source with various flux density, which has been used for the beam
characterization in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam}. However, the side lobes
and first error beams are not masked for the beam size
monitoring. The $\sigma_\star$ estimates are slightly
larger for sources bright enough for the side lobes to be well above
the noise level. An empirical model for the induced correlation of
$\sigma_\star$ with the source flux density is given in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_correction}.

The photometric correction thus relies on the measure of the current beam
size $\sigma'$. The induced uncertainties on the flux density
measurements depends on the precision of which we are able to monitor
the beam size. We perform two case studies, which correspond to the
two beam monitoring methods discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}.\\
%\new{the paragraph titled ``Demonstration case''} presents a demonstration
%calibration assuming the beam is precisely monitored, whereas
%the ``Practical case using pointing scans'' paragraph addresses a practical calibration relying
%on a beam monitoring using pointing scans. 

\noindent \emph{Demonstration case:} This method, shortened as {\tt PC-demo}
hereafter, uses a photometric correction based on the beam monitoring
with bright source scans. Both the 2D Gaussian FWHM fit and the
fixed-FWHM Gaussian photometry are performed on the map of the
source. This method thus applies only on point-like
sources that are bright enough for an accurate fit of the beam to be
obtained using a single scan.

To capture only the beam size variations driven by the
observing conditions (primary mirror deformations, anomalous
refraction, elevation), a small correction $\delta_{\rm{geom}}$ has to be made to
the 2D Gaussian beam FWHM estimate for bright sources. The estimate of the
actual Gaussian size $\sigma '$ is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\sigma '} = \sigma_{\rm{geom}} - \frac{\delta_{\rm{geom}}}{2\sqrt{2 \ln{2}}}, 
\end{equation} 
where the offset $\delta_{\rm{geom}}$ is null for faint or moderately
bright point sources, and non-zero for bright sources.
As for $\sigma_\star$,  the 2D Gaussian fit yields slightly broaden
$\sigma_{\rm{geom}}$ for bright sources (e.g. planets) to accomodate
for the side lobes, which are measured with high signal-to-noise.
For Uranus, $\delta_{\rm{geom}}$ includes also the beam widening due
to Uranus disc, which is seen with a diameter of about $3.5''$ at the
IRAM 30-m telescope latitude. We measure Uranus $\delta_{\rm{geom}}$
by comparing the average $\sigma_{\rm{geom}}$ estimates using Uranus
scans and using MWC349 scans, we found $\delta_{\rm{geom}} = 0.4''$ at
1-mm and $\delta_{\rm{geom}} = 0.25''$ at 2-mm, which basically
distributes as one half being due to Uranus finite extension and the
other half stemming from the side lobes.\\

\noindent \emph{Practical case using pointing scans:} This method,
shortened as {\tt PC-point} hereafter, performs a photometric correction
based on the beam monitoring with pointing scans. Unlike
{\tt PC-demo}, this method is thus usable even for sources fainter
than about
one Jy. The actual Gaussian beam size $\sigma '$ is estimated using
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\sigma '} = \sigma_{\rm{p}} - \frac{\delta_{\rm{p}}}{2\sqrt{2 \ln{2}}}, 
\end{equation} 
where $\sigma_{\rm{p}}$ is the beam size estimate interpolated from
the pointing-based beam monitoring and the offset $\delta_{\rm{p}}$
only accounts for the source finite extension. It is null for
point-like sources and equals to $0.2''$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and $0.13''$
at $2\,\rm{mm}$ for pointing scan of Uranus. No other contribution
enters $\delta_{\rm{p}}$ since pointing scan maps have a low signal-to-noise
ratio that prevents the geometrical FWHM from being significantly affected by the
side lobes.

\subsubsection{Absolute calibration with a photometric correction}

We perform the absolute calibration by i) implementing the practical
method described in Sect.~\ref{se:practical_calib}, ii) correcting the
atmospheric attenuation using the {\tt corrected skydip} opacity
estimates, and iii) using the photometric correction of
Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_correction_method}.

Using the photometric correction alleviates the need of
performing a scan selection based on the observation date. However,
the scans from which the absolute calibration is derived, are selected
on the FWHM estimate using the same criteria as for the baseline
calibration, that are FWHM thresholds of $12.5''$ at $1\, \rm{mm}$ and $18''$ at
$2\, \rm{mm}$. Thus, only the scans that are moderately affected by the beam
effect are included in the absolute calibration in order not to
include twice the photometric correction uncertainties in the error
budget (once for the absolute calibration and once for the photometry).

Figure~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_photocorr} presents the Uranus
measured-to-predicted flux density ratio as a function of the beam FWHM
after the photometric correction with the {\tt PC-demo} and
{\tt PC-point} methods. The flux
density is stable against the beam FWHM within uncertainties for both
wavelengths.


We further quantify the
difference between all the calibration methods that have been tested
in evalutating i) the average absolute calibration factor
with respect to the baseline calibration factor and
ii) the rms dispersion of the measured-to-modeled flux ratio. These
quantities are gathered in Table~\ref{tab:Abs_calibration_results_all}
in the rows labeled 'Factor' and 'RMS' respectively. 

We find that, resorting to a photometric correction i) allows us to use $45\%$ more
scans for the absolute calibration, ii) has a negligeable impact on
the absolute calibration factor and iii) yields a small reduction of
the flux density ratio dispersion. For the absolute calibration, the
{\tt PC-point} method performs as well as the {\tt PC-demo} one.
Photometry capability and stability when using a photometric
correction will be further tested in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.
