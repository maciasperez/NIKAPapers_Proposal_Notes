       {We use a large data set acquired between January 2017 and

       {We report a fully covered instantaneous FOV of 6.5'

         ($90\%$) of %detectors usable for science analysis
         valid detectors
         at $150\,\rm{GHz}$ ($260\,\rm{GHz}$). The beam pattern is characterized
         by a FWHM of $17.6'' \pm 0.2''$
         and  $11.1''\pm 0.1''$, and a beam efficiency of
         $77\% \pm 2\%$ and $55\% \pm 3\%$

         The statistical calibration uncertainties are of about $3\%$

         the accuracy of the methods that we have deployed to correct for
         atmospheric attenuation. The noise equivalent
         flux density (NEFD) at $150$ and $260\,\rm{GHz}$ are of

         $30 \pm 3\, \rm{mJy}/{beam}.s^{1/2}$
         This state-of-the-art performance confers NIKA2 with
         excellent mapping speeds of 
         $1388 \pm 174$ and

\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{se:summary}

%NIKA2, installed at the IRAM 30-m telescope since
%October 2017, is an open multi-purpose millimeter experiment which will operate for at
%least ten years. 
We have presented NIKA2 performance assessment in intensity after one
year of operation at the IRAM 30-m telescope, using a large number of
observations of primary and secondary calibrators and faint sources
that span the whole range of observing elevation and atmospheric
conditions encountered on-site.

\begin{enumerate}
\item %\emph{FOV reconstruction}:
  All designed KIDs detect the
  signal at least in some observation
  scans. We conservatively retain only the most stable KIDs, which are
  immune to the cross-talking effect and yield good signal-to-noise
  measurement. We defined 'valid' KIDs as the detectors that have been
  retained in at least two independent KID selections.
  We report valid KID fractions of $84\%$
  for the $1\,\rm{mm}$ channel arrays and $90\%$ for Array 2. The other
  KIDs, which do not meet the validity criterion, are ramdomly
  distributed across the FOV, so that the whole $6.6\,\rm{arcmin}$ FOV is
  covered.
  %Considering the designed KID grid as discussed in
  %Sect.~\ref{se:grid_distortion}, the distance between
  %neighbour KIDs is $9.8''$, $9.7''$ and $13.3''$ for Array 1, 3 and 2
  %respectively, which defined an occupation surface per KID. The area
  %covered by all KIDs is in turn associated to a measured total FOV of
  %$6.6$~arcmin diameter for each array.
  %The surface
  %covered by all valid KID is in turn associated to an effective FoV of
  %$5.7'$ for Array 1$\&$3 and of $5.9'$ for Array 2.

  %% F\lambda = gridstep\times D(30m)/\lambda
  
\item %\emph{Beam Properties:}
  While the full beam pattern presents a
  complex structure, the main beam is well described with a 2D
  Gaussian of FWHM of $11''$ for the $1\,\rm{mm}$ channel arrays
  and $17.6''$ for Array 2, with uncertainties of $0.2''$ for the
  combination of Array 1$\&$3 and for Array 2.
  Comparing the main beam fit to the measured full beam, we have derived the
  main beam efficiency up to a radius of $180''$. We found beam
  efficiencies of $55 \pm 3 \%$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and $77 \pm 2 \%$ at
  $2\,\rm{mm}$.
  For taking into account the fraction of the full beam stemming from
  beyond $180''$, the beam efficiency estimates must be corrected by a
  factor of about $0.65$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and about $0.8$ at
  $2\,\rm{mm}$~\citep{Greve2010, Kramer2013}.
  %These meet the expectations for an instrument that does not
  %resort to feed horns.
  %The chosen $180''$ cutting radius ensures an accurate
  %measure of the beam patterning using a single \bm\ scan. However,
  %dedicated studies based on the Lunar edge observations showed that
  %a sizable fraction of the full beam stems from beyond this
  %radius. This fraction is about $35\%$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and about $20\%$
  %at $2\,\rm{mm}$ (using Kramer et al 2013).
  Using individual map per KID, \citet{Adam2018} reported an rms
  dispersion of the main beam FWHM across the FOV of about $0.6''$ at
  both wavelengths.
  %was measured in rms
  %dispersions of about $0.6''$ at both wavelengths using N2R9 data.
  %These
  %constitute a conservative estimate since the rms dispersion has been
  %further improved by optimizing the telescope focus settings from N2R12
  %on.  
%
  % calib
\item %\emph{Calibration uncertainties:}
  We evaluated the statistical calibration uncertainties using 264 
  scans of sources selected on the observing UT hour basis and whose
  flux density is above about one Jy/beam. We find rms calibration
  uncertainties of about $6\%$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and about $3\%$ at
  $2\,\rm{mm}$, which are state-of-the-art performance for an instrument
  operated at these wavelengths. 
  
  % noise&sensitivity
\item %\emph{Sensitivity:}
  The noise does well integrate as the square root of the integration time
  for series of scans acquired in similar observing conditions. We
  have derived robust estimate of the NEFD using more than one
  thousand scans encompassing a large range of observing
  conditions. We found NEFD at zero atmospheric opacity of
  $30 \pm 3\,\rm{mJy}/{beam}.s^{1/2}$ at
  $1\, \rm{mm}$ and $9 \pm 1\,\rm{mJy}/{beam}.s^{1/2}$ at $2\, \rm{mm}$.
  %The NEFD estimates reported in
  %Table~\ref{tab:nika2summary} are based on more than one thousand scans
  %acquired during N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14, and thus constitute
  %conservative estimates that encompass a large range of observing
  %conditions, as addressed in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_results}.
  Furthermore, better NEFD have been found using homogeneous series of
  about one hundred scans of e.g. \hls\,. The conservative NEFD
  estimate reaches the goal value at $2\,\rm{mm}$. However, it is
  measured as slightly above the specifications at
  $1\,\rm{mm}$. Indeed, the instrumental sensitivity at $1\,\rm{mm}$
  is at present mainly limited by the non-optimal transmission of
  the air-gap dichroic, mostly prominent in one polarisation (A1) but
  affecting the other (A3) as well.
%Actions are on-going to produce and test new
%hot-pressed dichroics. We warn however that this task is far from
%trivial.
  In addition to the dichroic upgrade, further possible areas of
  improvements for the $1\,\rm{mm}$ observation channel are: 1)
  improve the data processing and in particular the noise
  decorrelation methods, 2) increase the bandwidth of the $1\,\rm{mm}$
  arrays (subjected to the improvement of the dichroic) and 3)
  upgrade the surface of the telescope.
%\new{We have identified several areas of improvement that will make NIKA2
%more sensitive at 1~mm: 1)~change the dichroic element (one of
%the 1~mm polarization components (A1) is absorbed more than the other (A3)
%with the present dichroic), 2)~improve the data processing and in
%particular the noise decorrelation methods, 3)~upgrade the 1~mm
%arrays, 4)~increase the bandwidth of the 1~mm arrays, and 5)~upgrade
  %the surface of the telescope.}
  
\item  NIKA2 mapping capabilities are better estimated by evaluating the
  mapping speed, which is defined as the sky area that is covered in one
  hour of observation to a noise level of $1\,\rm{mJy}$. We found
  mapping speeds at zero atmospheric opacity of $111$ and
  $1388\, \rm{arcmin}^2 \rm{mJy}^{-2} h^{-1}$ at
  $1\, \rm{mm}$ and  $2\, \rm{mm}$. NIKA2 mapping speed is thus at
  least an order of magnitude better than the previous generation of the IRAM
 30-m telescope resident instruments~\citep{Catalano2014, Staguhn2011_GISMO, Kreysa1999}.
  
\end{enumerate}

The main characteristics that define the NIKA2 performance are
summarized in Table~\ref{tab:nika2summary}.
We conclude that NIKA2 has unique capabilities in fast dual-band
mapping at tens arcsecond resolution. NIKA2 performance meet the
requirements to address some of the most exciting open questions in
astrophysics and cosmology.
