\begin{itemize}
\item explain how the 4f harmonics separates from the scanning frequencies
\item derive constraints on precession, nutation and scanning speed vs HWP
  speed.
\item Number of samples per beam vs combination of kids to produce a map: one
  map is the average of N independent maps *only* if *each* KID produces a full
  map. Otherwise it's a somehow classic combination of different detectors
\end{itemize}
