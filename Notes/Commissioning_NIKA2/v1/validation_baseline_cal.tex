\section{Baseline calibration results {\color{blue} Laurence $\rightarrow$ Juan}}
%\label{se:valid_baseline_cal}

The baseline calibration accuracy and stability are primarily assessed
using two quantities. We define the calibration bias $b$ for array $i$ as
the ratio between the measured flux density $\hat{S_{i}}$ using the
Gaussian fixed-width beam photometry as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:cal_HA} and the flux density expectations $\hat{S}$ as
given in Sect.~\ref{se:ref_flux_secondaries}. From a series of
secondary calibrator scans, we evaluate
\begin{itemize}
\item[i)] the average calibration bias per array $b_{\rm A_i}$,
  which by construction, should be equal to unity within the precision
  with which the expected flux densities are known. Moreover, 
  the calibration bias stability against the observed opacity provides
  us with a robustness test of the opacity correction, and the stability
  againts the measured beam size, a test of the photometric
  susceptibility to optical variations. %(driven by the main dish
  %distortions)
\item[ii)] the standard deviation from the mean $\sigma_{\rm A_i}$,
  which consists in an estimate of the statistical calibration
  uncertainties that encloses errors of optical, atmospheric, noise
  and data processing origins. Added in quadrature with the model
  uncertainties reported in Moreno et al., it represents a
  conservative estimate of the total absolute calibration errors.
\end{itemize}


The baseline calibration, discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration}, is primarily
validated by estimated the flux density of MWC349. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:mwc349_flux_obstau}, we present MWC349
measured-to-expected flux density ratios for the three considered
campaigns and check the ratio stability against the observed opacity,
modeled as the estimated zenith opacity (see Sect.~\ref{se:opacities}) multiplied
by the airmass at the telescope average elevation during the scan.

  ? }

In a broad range of atmospheric conditions, which covers observed opacities from 0.2 to
0.7 at $1~\rm{mm}$, no sizable systematic effects are seen. However, at low observed
opacity ($<0.2$ at $1~\rm{mm}$), flux densities tend to exceed
the average flux densities. This excess reaches about $15\%$ at the
lowest observed opacities that have been probed.

%We conclude that the photometry relying on the baseline
%calibration, is accurate and robust against atmospheric
%conditions.
The detailed results of the calibration validation are
presented in Table~\ref{tab:baseline_calib_result_mwc349}.

      green). The flux ratios are consistent with unity for the
      $1~\rm{mm}$ observations within $1\sigma$ errors, whereas a
      small but statistically significant discrepancy is observed at
      $2~\rm{mm}$ with respect to the flux expectations from the Plateau
      de Bure (PdB) SED extrapolated in NIKA2 bands. This lack of flux
      w.r.t. PdB, which is stable through the three campaigns, suggesting it
      does not depends on the observing conditions, is further
      discussed in the text.}

      Datapoints denote the flux ratio of MWC349 in orange, CRL2688 in

      Whereas MWC349 is point-like in NIKA2 bands, CRL2688 is slightly
      extended and the planetary nebulea NGC7027 partly resolved. The
      latter is thus less suited to check point-source
      photometry. CRL2688 has flux ratios consistent with unity in both
      NIKA2 bands: NIKA2 measurements for this secondary calibrator
      are in excellent agreement with SCUBA2 flux estimates. In
      addition, flux ratios are constant within statistical
      uncertainties against both the beam size and the observed
      opacity.}
