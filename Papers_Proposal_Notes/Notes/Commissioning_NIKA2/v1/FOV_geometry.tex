We present an example of the FOV reconstruction in Fig.~\ref{fig:fov_ex}.

The FOV diameter is defined as 
\begin{equation}
FOV diameter = \sqrt{4 N_{tot. kids} \times gridstep^2/\pi}
\end{equation}

{\bf give the values of gridstep (pitch) both in mm and arcsec on the sky}\\

The same definition applies to ``Effective FOV'' to avoid extra multiplication
by the fraction of valid pixels

\begin{equation}
F\lambda = gridstep\times D(30m)/\lambda

In order to identify the most stable pixels, we compare the KID parameters
obtained with several beam maps.  In the following, we show results as obtained
using seven \bms\ from Run10, two from Run9 and one from Run8.  For each
pixel we compute the average position on the focal plane and the average FWHM,
counting the times that it has been considered as valid.

In Fig. \ref{fig:avg_fov_color} we show the average focal plane
reconstruction, from green to red depending on the number of times
that the pixel has been considered as valid. For A1, A3 and A2,
respectively, we have 952, 961, and 553 pixels that have been
considered as valid at least twice (840, 508, 868 valid at least five
times).
% LP: add a sentence to reference Table ``\ref{tab:number_of_kids}"
Using this criterion, we deduce the fraction of valid detectors over the
designed ones, as given in Table~\ref{tab:number_of_kids}.  As a second step, we
also flag pixels that move across the focal plane from a beam map to another
%(Fig. \ref{fig:jumping_kids}, jumping KIDs)
and those who share the same
position (twin KIDs). To identify the former, we look at the difference of the
mean and median position of each KID, for the latter a criterion on the position
is applied in order to find the pixels that are closer than the grid step. Each
detector showing one of these behaviour is marked as unvalid.

\subsection{FOV grid distortion {\color{blue} Nico et Xavier }  }
\label{se:grid_distortion}

We studied the matching of the KIDs position on the sky to the
\emph{design} position, as decribed in detail in this wiki post\footnote{see

}
The global result is scaling, rotation, and shift parameters for each
array. They are described in Table~\ref{ta:gridmatch}.

\caption[Field-of-view deformations]{Linear 2D fit of the observed position of the detectors in the sky

\end{table}

It shows that on average the position of each detector is known to better than
an arcsecond. The 1mm arrays have almost the same center but this center
differs by 7 and 2 arseconds from the 2mm array center. The sampling is above
$\lambda/D$ at 1 mm. Note that the plate rotation angle was designed as
76.2\,degrees, less than 2 degrees from what is observed. We find that array 1
has the most deviant detectors (above 4 arcseconds from their expected
position). These detectors should be excluded from further analysis. We call
distortion (in the table) the $x.y$ term in the polynomial fitting between the
design grid and the observed position (the fitting is done with the $x$ and
$y$ linear terms and $x.y$ term). 



This has been compared to expectations obtained using ZEMAX
simulation. The grid diagram generated using ZEMAX provides us with
the maximum dispersion in the field defined by

\begin{equation}
P = \frac{\sqrt{(x_p - x_r)^2 + (y_p - y_r)^2}}{\sqrt{x_p^2 + y_p^2}},
\end{equation}

where $(x_p, y_p)$ and $(x_r, y_r)$ are respectivelly the predicted
and real coordinates on the image surface relative to the reference
field position image location (see page 170 of the ZEMAX manual, 2007).
The predicted coordinates for the whole field are obtained using a
linear interpolation of a small area in the field central part,
whereas the real coordinates are calculated by ray tracing through the
optical system.

 \label{fig:fov_grid_distortion_zemax}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:fov_grid_distortion_zemax} show the ZEMAX grid diagram for
NIKA2 simulated optic system. The maximum grid distortion is expected
to be of $2.7\%$ in NIKA2 $6.5'$ FOV. The distortion is the most
noticeable in the upper right corner of the Nasmyth plan, which is
also the area of the largest defocus w.r.t. to the center. 

An expected distortion of $2.7\%$ is at most a 5 arcsecond shift from the
center to the outside of the array.  The quoted measured distortions are not
too dissimilar once the different fitting methods have been taken into
account.

% FXD: this would need to be more ascertained. Lack of time to go further.


%% [Optimal Focus]
%%________________________________________________________
\subsection{Reconstruction of the focus surfaces {\color{blue} Laurence} }
\label{sec:focus_surfaces}

Owing to the NIKA2 $6.5~\rm{arcmin}$ FOV, the focus is expected to
slightly changes across the FOV, defining curved focal surfaces at the
location of the three arrays. Therefore, beam patterns are expected to
show some scatter across the FOV accordingly to the focal
surfaces. Although all the detectors cannot be individually focalised,
an optimal axial focus of the telescope can be found to maximize the
number of detectors at the best focus and hence, maximize the
resolution of the NIKA2 maps.
This optimal z-focus setting is obtained
in measuring the focus at the center of the arrays as described
Sect.~\ref{sec:focus-meas} and apply a focus shift, which is primary
predicted using Zemax simulation, and ultimately verified by measuring
the focus surfaces as decribed here.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[trim={0, 1cm, 0, 1cm}, clip, angle=0, scale=0.5]{Figures/fov_focus_mv_5.png}
\caption[Focus surfaces]{Focus surface of A1, A3 and A2 arrays from left to
  right. From top to bottom, the focus estimates rely on
  FWHM-minimization, amplitude-maximization of an elliptical
  Gaussian of fixed FWHMs and amplitude-maximization of an elliptical
  Gaussian.}
\label{fig:focus-surfaces}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\emph{Method. } We measure NIKA2 focal surfaces by means of a sequence of five 'beam-map'
scan observations of bright point-like sources, typically Planets or
bright quasars,
for various settings of the telescope axial focus around the
optimal focus $z_{\rm{opt}}$. A beam-map scan consists of a deep-integrated
$13.5' \times 7.8'$ OTF-scan observation comprizing $99$ sub-scans and
with a scanning speed of either $65''/s$ whenever the mean integration
elevation is $< 60$ degree or $39"/s$ at higher elevation. The z-focus is changed in step of
$0.6~\rm{mm}$ to probe a large focus range for measuring even the
extreme variation of the focus surfaces,
namely $z \in \{-1.2, -0.6, 0, 0.6, 1.2 \} + z_{\rm{opt}}$.
Each beam-map scans allow for $4''$-resolution individual maps per kid to
be projected. Before the projection, the correlated noise is mitigated
from each KID timeline in subtrating out a common mode, which is obtained
using, amongst the other detectors, those that correlates the most
with this KID and that are located outside a radius of $90''$
around the source centroid.
Therefore, a series of five cleaned maps at various focus is
available for each detector, from which the best focus is estimated as
described in Sect.~\ref{sec:focus-meas}. The ensemble of the relative
focus estimate per KIDs with respect to the best focus at the center
of the array constitutes the focus surface. An accurate estimate of
the center focus is obtained as the
weighted average focus estimate of the KIDs lying in a $30''$ radius
around the geometrical center of the array. This average does not
induce any sizeable bias thanks to the flatness of the focus surface
in the innermost regions. For robustness test, we consider three focus
estimates: the two first ones are the same as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{sec:focus-meas} -- namely i) $\hat z_{\rm{fwhm}}$ the focus that
minimizes the geometrical FWHM and ii) $\hat z_{\rm{peak}}$ the focus
that maximizes the amplitude of the best-fitting ellitical Gaussian --
whereas the third one is $\hat z_{\rm{flux}}$ the focus that maximizes
the amplitude of the best-fitting elliptical Gaussian of fixed FWHM
(at $12''$ at $260~\rm{GHz}$ and $18''$ at $150~\rm{GHz}$). The 
comparison between the two amplitude-based estimators
($\hat z_{\rm{peak}}$ and $\hat z_{\rm{flux}}$), will test the
stability of the focus results against the exact choice of the beam fitting
function. Since the ellipticity-based estimator $\hat z_{\rm{ellip}}$ is
less sensitive to focus changes and yields larger uncertainties than the
others, we do not use it for the focus surface reconstruction.     


\emph{Data selection. }
During the three commissioning campaigns that occured after the change of A1
lens and the improvement of internal optics alignment (hence in the
final NIKA2 optic configuration),
nine out-of-focus
beam-map scan sequences have been acquired, including incomplete
sequences and sequences hindered by poor atmospheric conditions. We
select sequences that i) comprises at least four scans, ii) have been
observed at zenith opacity at $225~\rm{GHz}$ (as indicated by
the IRAM taumeter) below 0.5 and iii) have a maximal central focus
drift between the starting time and the end of the sequence of
$0.5~\rm{mm}$. These criteria preserve five sequences from which focus
surfaces can be reconstructed. Namely, we consider the sequences
$20170226s415\mbox{--}419$, $20170419s133\mbox{--}137$, $20170420s113\mbox{--}117$,
$20170421s160\mbox{--}164$ and $20170424s123\mbox{--}127$, which consist of observations
of the bright quasar '3C84' and Neptune.

\emph{Results. }
For each detector $k$ and each beam-map sequence $s$, we obtain for
the array $a$, a focus measurement $z_k^{a, s} \pm \sigma_k^{a, s}$,
where $\sigma_k^{a, s}$ is the $1\mbox{--}\sigma$ error of the least-square
polynomial fit. The focus surface measurements per array obtained from the five
beam-map sequences are combined using an inverse-variance weighting
scheme to obtain the focus surface estimates 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mv_focus_surf}
z_k^{(a)} = \left( \sigma_k^{(a)} \right)^2 \,  \sum_s \frac{z_k^{a,s}}{\left(\sigma_k^{a,s}\right)^2}\, \,  ,
\end{equation}
with uncertainties 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:error_mv_focus_surf}
\sigma_k^{(a)} = \left[ \sum_s \frac{1}{\left(\sigma_k^{a,s}\right)^2}\right]^{-1/2}\, .
\end{equation}


We present NIKA2 focus surfaces per arrays obtained as in
Eq.~\ref{eq:mv_focus_surf} 
%from the inverse-variance weighted combination of the five
%reconstructed focus surfaces per arrays
in Fig.~\ref{fig:focus-surfaces}.
The three flavours of focus-estimators provide us with focus surfaces
per arrays that are in good agreement with each others and that have a
non-axisymetrical flatten bowl shape consistent with expectations from
simulation {\bf [TBA, as discussed further below]}.
The median defocus (that is the relative focus w.r.t. the center)
across the detectors is about
$-0.1~\rm{mm}$ for the three arrays. Maximal defocus values of about
$-0.6~\rm{mm}$ are found for detectors located in the outer top and
left regions of the FOV. Finally, a fraction comprised between $20$
and $30\%$ of the KIDs has a relative $z\le -0.2~\rm{mm}$.  

In Sect.~\ref{ap:focus_surfaces}, we further test the stability of the
focus surfaces by comparing results from a series of beam-map
sequences acquired at various date and under various atmospheric
conditions. We found the focus surfaces to be stable against
observation dates and atmospheric conditions.
 
We primarily estimate the uncertainty of the focus
surface measurements using the standard deviation between the three
estimators $z_k^{(a)}|_{\rm{fwhm}}$, $z_k^{(a)}|_{\rm{peak}}$ and
$z_k^{(a)}|_{\rm{flux}}$. We found approximatively homogeneous
standard deviation surfaces per arrays, which have median values across
the FOV of about $0.03~\rm{mm}$.
However, we cross-check this error estimate by forming the quadratic mean of
the three inverse-variance error surfaces per arrays, which are defined in
Eq.~\ref{eq:error_mv_focus_surf} and quoted
$\sigma_k^{(a)}|_{\rm{fwhm}}$, $\sigma_k^{(a)}|_{\rm{peak}}$ and
$\sigma_k^{(a)}|_{\rm{flux}}$. This provides us with more optimistic
error surfaces per array, which do not show any clear pattern across
the FOV and which have a median value across the detectors of about
$0.015~\rm{mm}$.
