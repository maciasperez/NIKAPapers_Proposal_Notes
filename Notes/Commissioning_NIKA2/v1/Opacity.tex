In NIKA2, the opacity is measured via a total-power technique, which was
successfully tested with NIKA. The details of this technique and its agreement
with the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) model
(\cite{2001IEEE....49.1683C}) are described in \cite{Catalano:2014nml}. The
underlying idea is to replace the opacity, usually delivered by the resident
IRAM tau-meter that performs elevation scans at a fixed azimuth and is
operating at 225\,GHz, by a measurement that uses the NIKA2 instrument itself
as a tau-meter. Using this procedure we can directly derive an opacity
integrated in the NIKA2 very bandpasses and in the same line-of-sight of the
source in the considered map. For that purpose, we assume that the resonance
frequency of each KID varies linearly with the total power. First, we have to
calibrate the relationship between total power and opacity. Then we can use
that calibration to measure the opacity during a given scan.

%	skydip-based Method
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Skydip-based method}
\label{se:skydip-method}

For each KID $k$, the absolute value of the resonance frequency
$f_{tone}^k$ moves with the atmospheric load according to

\begin{equation}
\ftone^k  = C_0^k - C_1^k T_{atm}[1-e^{-\tau/\sin\delta}]
\label{eq:skydip}
\end{equation}

%FXD corrected 
%{\bf LP: pourquoi signe plus alors qu'on utilise un signe moins dans
%  Eq. 2 du papier instru ?}

where $C_0^k$ is a constant equal to the resonance
frequency at zero opacity, $C_1^k$ is the calibration conversion
factor in kHz$/$K, $T_{atm}$ is the equivalent temperature
of the atmosphere (taken as a constant at 270~K), $\tau$ the zenith
opacity and $\delta$ the average elevation of the telescope.
By assuming a homogeneous plane-parallel atmosphere, the airmass $x$ is defined from the
elevation as $x = \left(\sin\delta\right)^{-1}$. 

The coefficients $C_0^k$ and $C_1^k$ are expected to be constant in
time within at least a cooldown cycle, and are determined using a {\tt
skydip} procedure. This consists in moving the telescope in elevation
step by step and monitoring, for each kid, the evolution of $\ftone^k$
versus the air mass and to fit the zenith opacity $\tau$ and $C_0^k$
and $C_1^k$. This process is realised by performing a skydip scan, as
defined in~Sect.~\ref{se:skydip}. The acquisition time spend on each
elevation step, wich is of about twenty seconds, is chosen to reduce
the error in the determination of $\ftone^k$.

All skydips, obtained under various opacity
conditions, are analysed together to break the degeneracies between
the opacity and the responsivity ($C_1^k$). The procedure has two steps.
First, all the skydips are analysed individually to simply extract
$\ftone^k$ for each stable elevation. Secondly, a simultaneous fit is done
for all 
parameters ($\tau$, $C_0^k$ and $C_1^k$.)
Error bars on $\tau$ are estimated by doing
this procedure on blocks of 40 kids only and getting a dispersion on the
resulting $\tau$ from the different blocks. Usually the dispersion comes out as
$4\times 10^{-3}$ at 1 mm and $1\times 10^{-3}$ at 2 mm. Once the $\tau$ values
are estimated for each skydip (as the average over the blocks), we compute
(while fixing $\tau$) the $C_0$ and $C_1$ final values for each KID. We thus
retrieve the coefficients of all the KIDs even though some of them could not
contribute to the $\tau$ determination.

This procedure consists thus in fitting a couple of paramaters ($C_0$,
$C_1$) for each of the several thousand valid KIDs. This requires to
have on hands a sizable amount of skydip scans -- typically ten to
twenty -- that i) span the whole opacity range and ii) avoid hightly
perturbated atmosphere to met the plane-parallel atmosphere
assumption. To that aim, we recommand to perform a skydip scan twice a
day during a scientific campagn. Then during the ($C_0$, $C_1$)
determination process, the skydip scan are thoroughtly selected.

   
\subsection{Skydip selection}


\begin{figure}[p]

\caption{N2R9 skydip scan selection. Median dT quality-fit criterion is plotted in fonction of Median rms criterion for each skydip scans of the N2R9 campaign and for the three arrays. Both criteria are nicely correlated. Empty diamonds show the results of the first iteration of the skydip coefficient estimation, whereas filled circled show the second iteration, for which only the skydips that met both fit-quality criteria are included. After the second iteration, all the remaining skydips met the criteria.}
\label{fig:skydipselection}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For each skydip scan and for each bunch of 40 KIDs, we compute the
difference between the measured KID resonance frequency and the model
given in Eq.~\ref{eq:skydip} taken at the best-fit values of the
($C_0$, $C_1$) parameters. Then we determine two indicators
of the fit quality per skydip. First, the standard deviation of the
measure-to-model difference is calculated over all the KIDs in a
bunch. For each skydip, we evaluate the median rms, which is the
median over the KID bunches of the standard deviation per bunch, given
in Hz. Secondly, for each scan, we compute the average
measure-to-model difference of each KID $k$, labelled $dT_k$, which is
then converted from Hertz to Kelvin using the $C_1$ parameter of the
KID $k$. Median $dT$ is the median of $dT_k$ over all the KID of an
array. With these two indicators in hands, we discard the skydip scans
that are noisy or that yield a poor fit by applying the selection
criteria

\begin{itemize}
\item Median $\rm{rms} < 1.5 \times 10^{4}~\rm{Hz}$
\item Median $dT < 1.6~\rm{K}$
\end{itemize}

The threshold values have been determined using the set of 44 skydip
scans of N2R9. The Median rms cut corresponds to twice the median of
this quantity per skydip scan, whereas the Median $dT$ cut is twice
the standard deviation of Median $dT$ over the skydips. N2R9 skydip
scan selection is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:skydipselection}, in
which the agreement between the two fit-quality criteria is clearly
seen. The ($C_0$, $C_1$) estimation proceeds in two steps: first the
parameters are estimated using all the available skydip scan for a
given campaign, then the estimation is re-iterated using the only
skydip scans that met the fit-quality criteria. After the second
iteration, we check that no extra skydip outlier are left, as shown by
the 'v2' label data points in Fig.~\ref{fig:skydipselection}.


\addparag{stability against the skydip scan selection + FIG}
We test the stability of the ($C_0$, $C_1$) parameters against the exact choice of the selection criteria.  
At 1mm, we find about {\color{red} $[$TBC$]$  $10\%$} opacity variation from very inclusive to very aggressive selections. However, at 2mm, this scatter reachs about {\color{red} $[$TBC$]$  $30\%$} relative uncertainties.


We conclude that opacities at 1mm can be reliably estimated from a series of skydip scans using the (C0, C1) model. By contrast, for the 2mm opacities, a skydip-based method is not stable enough against the skydip selection. Thus, we adopt an hybrid approach. 

\subsection{The hybrid method}

The hybrid method comprizes two-steps: i) first the 1mm opacities,
that are $\tau_{A1}$ and $\tau_{A3}$, are determined using the skydip
method described in Sect.~\ref{se:skydip-method}, ii) then the 2mm
opacity $\tau_{A2}$ is extrapolated from the 1mm ones using a modified
ATM model. Namely, for the second step, we perform:

\begin{equation}
\tau_{A2} = \left( \left.\frac{\tau_{A2}^{\rm{ATM}}}{\tau_{A3}^{\rm{ATM}}}\right\vert_{\tau_{A3}} + \alpha \right) \tau_{A3},
\end{equation}

 where $\alpha$ is an offset, which are estimated from the observations themselves, and the ratio is the predicted zenith opacity ratio for A2 and A3 frequency bands using the ATM model described in \ref{Pardo2002} and taken at the measured A3 zenith opacity. The zenith opacity expectations for the array $A_i$ is
\begin{equation}
  \tau^{\rm{ATM}}_{A_i} = - \ln{\frac{\int e^{-\tau^{ATM}(\nu)} T_{A_i}(\nu) d\nu}{ \int T_{A_i}(\nu) d\nu}},
\end{equation}
where the bandpasses $T_{A_i}$ for arrays $A_i$, $i=1, 2, 3$, are the Martin-Pupplet reference transmissions
corrected by a Rayleigh-Jeans term  $T'_{A_i}(\nu) / \left( \frac{\nu}{\nu_0}\right)^2$. 

We observe that the measured \emph{shape} of the measured opacity ratio is well described by the ATM expectations whereas its \emph{amplitude} is too low by an offset $\alpha$, which we dertermine using a data-driven approach. We estimate $\alpha$ as the offset that ensures a stability of the A2 flux over the whole opacity span.

We observe that the skydip-fitted $\tau$ values are, as expected, common
between different detectors of the same array. By comparing the results of different skydips, we
have verified experimentally that the coefficients $C_0$, $C_1$ are stable,
within the fit errors, on very long time scales within a cooldown cycle. The
coefficients can thus be applied to the whole observing campaign in order to
recover the opacity of each scan.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:taumeas} {\bf(and Fig.~\ref{fig:taumeas_paper} of
  \ref{NIKA2-Tech}) } we present the evolution of the NIKA2 in-band
opacities for all the 'OTF' scans (about 1300 scans per runs) of the
N2R9 run held in February and the N2R10 run in April 2017. These are
compared to the IRAM tau-meter values. We observe an agreement on the global trend between the IRAM tau-meter opacity (225 GHz) and the NIKA2 values. These latter show, however,
a smaller dispersion (less than one percent).
