\section{Overview of KIDs}
\label{sec2}
\subsection{KID physics}

Kinetic inductance detectors are a novel superconducting detector technology that provides high sensitivity and ease of multiplexing. In this section we give a brief summary of the main features of KIDs.\\
KIDs are RLC superconducting resonators made from a thin metal film that react to an incoming radiation by changing their electromagnetic properties. In fact, when photons are absorbed by the superconducting film, they break Cooper pairs and change the ratio of paired (Cooper pair) and unpaired (quasi-particles) charge carriers. The breaking of Cooper pairs increases the quasi-particles density, which causes a change in the kinetic inductance $L_{k}$. This produces a shift of the resonant frequency of the KID \citep{2013A&A...551L..12C}. The absorbed optical power $P_{opt}$ can be directly related to the change in the resonant frequency $\delta f_{0}$, as the relationship between them is linear for small variations in $P_{opt}$ \citep{2010ApPhL..96z3511S}. The operating principle is represented in fig \ref{resonance}.\\

The optical power absorbed by the detector is weak for black curves and increases for red curves. The absorption of a photon shifts the resonance frequency and this is directly proportional to the received power.}

The KID transfer function is given by :

\begin{equation}
S_{21}(f) = I +jQ .
\end{equation}

where \I  and \Q  give respectively the real (in phase) and imaginary (quadrature) part of the ratio between the input and output signal of the feedline transmission. \\

\subsection{KID model}

In order to model the way a KID reacts to an incoming radiation, we calculate the KID transfer function by following the
parametrisation proposed by \citet{2008ApPhL..93m4102G} :

\begin{equation}
S_{21} = \frac{2Z_{res}Z_{0}}{Z_{res}[2Z_{0} + j(X_{1}+X_{2})] + (Z_{0} +jX_{1})(Z_{0} +jX_{2})},
\end{equation}

with :

\begin{equation}
Z_{res} = \frac{Z_{0}Q_{e}}{2Q_{i}}[1 + 2jQ_{i}\frac{(f-f_{0})}{f_{0}}].
\end{equation}

Where $X_{1}$, $X_{2}$, $Z_{0}$ are impedances, $Q_{i}$ is the intrinsic quality factor of the resonator and $Q_{e}$ is the external quality factor due to coupling with the measurement electronics. $f$ is the frequency of excitation to which the detector is submitted, and $f_{0}$ represents the resonant frequency.  We choose typical values of KIDs $X_{1} = X_{2} = 3 $ $\Omega $, $Z_{0} = 50$ $\Omega$, $Q_{i} \simeq 5.10^{4}$, $Q_{e} \simeq 2.10^{4}$ and $f_{0} = 1.273$x$10^{9}$ Hz.\\

In this paper we use this model to simulate the response of a KID when submitted to different sources of radiation. In order to reconstruct the signal given by a KID, two methods were developed and are presented in the following section.
