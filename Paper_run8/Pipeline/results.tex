\begin{itemize}
\item Show a few maps of (faint) point sources and report on sensitivity
  estimated on deep empty fields ?
\item Show maps of Taurus to illustrate the reconstruction of diffuse emission ?
\item and/or illustrate with results of previous runs ?
\item Careful with the overlap with Catalano et al...
