Sub-millimetre and millimetre domains offer a unique view of the
Universe from nearby astrophysical objects, including planets,
planetary systems, galactic sources\LEt{Please capitalise Galaxy and Galactic (adj.) when referring to \textit{our} local Galaxy. Please use lowercase when referring to other galaxies. Please check for this throughout for consistency. Thank you}, nearby galaxies, to high-redshift
cosmological probes, for example, distant dusty star-forming galaxies,
clusters of galaxies, cosmic infrared background (CIB), cosmic microwave
background (CMB).

Ground-based {\lp continuum} millimetre experiments have made spectacular progress in
the past-two decades thanks to the advent of large arrays of
high-sensitivity detectors~\citep{Wilson2008_AZTEC,
  Siringo2009_LABOCA, Staguhn2011_GISMO, Swetz2011_ACT, Monfardini2011_NIKA, Polarbear_2012, Bleem2012_SPT, Holland2013_SCUBA2,
  Dicker2014_MUSTANG2, BKS_2015, Adam2017, BICEP3_2018}. 
This fast growth will continue as experimental efforts are
driven by two challenges: improving the sensitivity to
polarisation to detect the signature of
the end-of-inflation gravitational waves in the CMB, and {\rev
improving the angular resolution. The latter has several important
scientific implications: reaching arcminute angular resolution to
exploit the CMB secondary anisotropies as cosmological probes, and
sub-arcminute resolution to unveil the inner structure of faint or
complex astrophysical objects and to map the early universe down to
the confusion limit.}
Furthermore, a new
generation of sub-arcminute millimetre experiments, like NIKA2, which
combines high angular resolution with a high mapping speed and a large
coverage in the frequency domain, is set to achieve a breakthrough in 
our detailed understanding of the formation and evolution of
structures throughout the Universe.


The New IRAM KID Array Two (NIKA2) is a sub-arcminute resolution
high mapping speed camera, which simultaneously observes a 6.5' diameter
field of view (FOV) in intensity in two
frequency channels centred at 150 and $260\,\rm{GHz}$ and in
polarisation at $260\, \rm{GHz}$~\citep{Adam2018}. The \LEt{Please avoid beginning sentences with abbreviations, acronyms, numbers in figures, and the like where possible. Please check for this throughout the paper.  See Sect. 6.2.1 of the Language Guide (https://www.aanda.org/for-authors/language-editing/1-introduction) }NIKA2 was installed
at the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope in October 2015 with partial readout
electronics, and it has operated in the final instrumental configuration since
January 2017. After a successful
commissioning phase that ended in October 2017, NIKA2 is
open to the community for scientific observations for the next
decade. The NIKA2 camera should provide key observations both at the galactic scale
and at high redshifts to address a plethora of open questions, including
the environmental impact on dust properties, the star formation processes
at low and high redshifts, the evolution of the large-scale structures,
and the exploitation of galaxy clusters for accurate cosmology.
%

At the galactic scale, progress in understanding the star formation
process relates to an accurate characterisation of dust properties in
the interstellar medium (ISM). The NIKA2 will provide the high-resolution,
high-mapping speed, dual-wavelength millimetre observations that are
required for the determination of the mass and emissivity of
statistically significant samples of dense, cold, star-forming
molecular clouds~\citep{Rigby2018}.
Deep multi-wavelength surveys of nearby galaxies and of large areas
of the galactic plane also make it possible to set constraints on
environmental variations of the dust properties.
Furthermore, NIKA2 observations are needed for a
detailed study of the inner molecular cloud filamentary structure that
hosts Solar-mass star progenitors~\citep{Bracco2017}, in order to
understand the evolution process that culminates in star
formation (see e.g. \citet{Andre2014} for a review). Ultimately, these
observations are also helpful for understanding planet formation within
proto-planetary discs.

For cosmology, NIKA2 observations have two major
implications. On one hand, they represent a unique opportunity to
study the evolution of the galaxy cluster mass calibration with
redshift and {\lp dynamical state} for their accurate exploitation as cosmological probes. 
Galaxy clusters are efficiently detected via the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect~\citep{SZ1970} up to high redshifts {\lp ($z<1.5$)}, as was recently
proven by CMB
experiments~\citep{Hasselfield2013_ACT_SZ, Reichardt2013_SPT_SZ, Planck2016_SZcat}.
The exploitation of the vast SZ-selected galaxy cluster catalogues is
currently the most powerful approach for cosmology with galaxy
clusters~\citep{Planck_2016_SZ_cosmo}. However, the accuracy of the tSZ cluster
cosmology relies on the calibration of the relation between the tSZ
observable and the cluster mass and on the assessment of both its redshift
evolution and the impact of the complex cluster physics on its calibration. 
Previous arcminute resolution experiments only allowed detailed studies
of the intra cluster medium spatial distribution for low redshift clusters (z <
0.2). Sub-arcminute resolution high mapping speed experiments are
required to extend our understanding of galaxy clusters towards high
redshift~\citep{Tony2019}. The first high-resolution
tSZ mapping of a galaxy cluster with NIKA2 is reported
in \citet{Ruppin2018}. Furthermore, NIKA2 capabilities for the
characterisation of high-redshift {\lp ($0.5<z<0.9$)} galaxy clusters
have been verified using numerical simulation~\citep{Ruppin2019}, and
their implication for cosmology is discussed
in \citet{Ruppin2019b}.


On the other hand, in-depth mapping of large extragalactic fields with
sub-arcminute resolution with NIKA2 should provide unprecedented insight
into the distant universe. 
{\lp Indeed, the high-angular resolution of NIKA2 is key to reducing the
confusion noise, which is the ultimate limit of single-dish cosmological
surveys~\citep{Bethermin2017_simu}, and the high mapping speed makes it possible to cover large areas.}
{\rev This unique combination is likely to result in the detection of hundreds of
dust-obscured optically-faint galaxies at very high redshift
($z \sim 6$) during their major episodes of star formation.}
This should help to quantify the star formation up to $z \sim 6$.
{\rev We note that galaxy redshifts  must be obtained with
spectroscopic follow-up observations (e.g. with NOEMA) or
multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution fittings
(e.g. in the GOODS-N field thanks to the tremendous amount of
ancillary data). Galaxy formation studies can also
benefit from the large instantaneous field-of-view, high-resolution
observations of NIKA2.}

Hundreds of dust-obscured optically-faint galaxies may indeed be
detected up to very high redshift ($z \sim 6$) during their major
episodes of star formation. The high angular resolution of NIKA2 is
key to reducing the confusion noise, which is the ultimate limit of
single-dish cosmological surveys~\citep{Bethermin2017_simu}, and the
high mapping speed allows us to cover large areas. This unique combination
helps to quantify the star formation history up to $z \sim
6$. We note that galaxy redshifts must be obtained with
spectroscopic follow-up observations (e.g. with NOEMA) or
multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution fittings (e.g. in the
GOODS-N field thanks to the tremendous amount of ancillary data).

The current generation of sub-arcminute resolution experiments also
includes the Large APEX Bolometer Camera
(LABOCA~\citep{Siringo2009_LABOCA}) at the Atacama
Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12-metre telescope, which covers a
12' diameter FOV at $345\, \rm{GHz}$ {\lp at an angular resolution of about
19''}; AzTEC at the 50-metre Large Millimeter Telescope, which operates with a
single bandpass centred at either 143, 217, or
$270\,\rm{GHz}$~\citep{Wilson2008_AZTEC}, {\lp and which has a beam
FWHM of 5, 10, or $18''$, respectively}; the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer
Array Two (SCUBA-2~\citep{Holland2013_SCUBA2,Dempsey2013_SCUBA2}) on the
15-metre James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, which simultaneously
images a FOV of about 7' at $353\,\rm{GHz}$ and $666\,\rm{GHz}$ {\lp with a main-beam FWHM of 13''
and 8'' in the two frequency channels, respectively;}
 MUSTANG-2 at the 100-metre Green Bank telescope,
which maps a 4.35' FOV at 
$90\,\rm{GHz}$ {\lp with 9'' resolution}~\citep{Dicker2014_MUSTANG2, Stanchfield2016_MUSTANG2}.
Therefore, NIKA2 is unique
in combining an angular resolution better than 20'', an instantaneous FOV of a
diameter of 6.5', and multi-band observation capabilities at $150$ and
$260\,\rm{GHz}$.


Most of the other millimetre instruments consist of bolometric cameras. By contrast,
NIKA2 is based on kinetic inductance detector (KID)
technology~\citep{Day2003, Doyle2008_LEKID, Shu2018_LEKID}. This concept was
first demonstrated with a pathfinder instrument,
NIKA~\citep{Monfardini2010_NIKA, Monfardini2011_NIKA}.
Installed at the IRAM 30-m telescope until 2015, NIKA demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance~\citep{Catalano2014} and obtained
breakthrough results
(see e.g.~\citet{Adam2014, Adam2017_kSZ}.
NIKA has been crucial in optimising the NIKA2 instrument and data
analysis. 

A thorough description of the NIKA2 instrument is presented in \citet{Adam2018},
along with the results of the commissioning in intensity based on the
data acquired during the two technical campaigns of 2017.

acquired during the February 2017 technical campaign (N2R9) and the
October 2017 (N2R12) and January 2018 (N2R14) first and second
scientific-purpose observation campaigns. {\lp These observation
campaigns are referred to as the \emph{reference observation campaigns}.}
Each campaign consists of about 1300 observation scans lasting between
two and twenty minutes for a total observation time of about 150 hours.

\section{General view of the instrument}
\label{se:instru}
%\input{Instrument.tex}

The NIKA2 simultaneously images a FOV of
6.5' in diameter at 150 and $260\,\rm{GHz}$. It also has polarimetry
capabilities at  $260\,\rm{GHz}$, which are not discussed here. 
To cover the 6.5'-diameter FOV without degrading the
telescope angular resolution, NIKA2 employs a total of around
2\,900\,KIDs split over three distinct arrays, one for the $150\,\rm{GHz}$
band and two for the $260\,\rm{GHz}$ band.

A detailed description of the instrument can be found in
\citet{Adam2018} and \citet{Calvo2016JLTP}. Here, we briefly present the main sub-systems
focusing on the elements that are specific to NIKA2
or that drive the development of dedicated procedures for the data
reduction or calibration.

\subsection{Cryogenics}

{\lp KIDs are superconducting detectors, which in the case of NIKA2 are made of
thin aluminium films deposited on a silicon substrate~\citep{Roesch2012_LEKID}.
For an optimal sensitivity, they must operate at a temperature of
around 150\,mK, which is roughly one order of magnitude lower than the
aluminium superconducting transition temperature.}  
For this reason,
NIKA2 employs a custom-built dilution fridge to cool down the focal plane, and the
refractive elements of the optics. Overall, a total mass of around
$100\, \rm{kg}$ is kept deeply in the sub-Kelvin regime. Despite the complexity
and huge size of the system, the operation of NIKA2 does not require
external cryogenic liquids and can be fully operated remotely.


\subsection{Optics}
\label{se:instru_optics}
The NIKA2 camera optics include two cold mirrors and six lenses. The
filtering of unwanted (off-band) radiation is provided by a suitable stack of
multi-mesh filters {\lp like thermal blockers} placed at all temperature
stages between 150\,mK and room temperature. {\lp Two aperture stops,
at a temperature of 150\,mK, are conservatively designed to limit the
entrance pupil of the optical system to the inner 27.5\,m diameter of
the primary mirror. }
An air-gap dichroic plate splits the 150\,GHz (reflection)
from the 260\,GHz (transmission) beams. {\lp This element, which is
made of a series of thin micron-like membranes separated by calibrated
rings and mounted on a native ring in stainless steel, has been designed to
resist to low temperature-induced deformation.}
As discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field}, the air-gap technology has
been proven to be efficient
in preserving the planarity of the dichroic, but shows sub-optimal
performance in transmission. Moreover, a grid polariser ensures the
separation of the vertical and horizontal components of the linear
polarisations on the 260\,GHz channel. Band-defining filters,
custom-designed to optimally match the atmospheric windows while
ensuring robustness against average atmospheric condition at 260\,GHz,
are installed in front of each array. A half-wave polarisation
modulator is added at room temperature when operating the instrument
in polarimetry mode.

Hereinafter, the detector array illuminated by the 150\,GHz
($2\, \rm{mm}$) beam is named Array 2 (A2), 
while in the 260\,GHz ($1.15\, \rm{mm}$) channel, the array mapping the
horizontal component of the polarisation is referred to as Array 1 (A1),
and the one mapping the vertical component is called Array 3 (A3). The
150\,GHz observing channel is referred to as the $2\, \rm{mm}$ band,
and the 260\,GHz channel as the $1\, \rm{-mm}$ band. 

\subsection{KIDs and electronics}
\label{se:array}

Array 2 consists of 616\,KIDs, arranged to cover a 78\,mm-diameter
circle. Each pixel has a size of $2.8\times2.8\textrm{\,mm}^2$, which
is the maximum pixel size allowed in order not to degrade the theoretical
\trentemetre\ telescope angular resolution. In the
case of the 260\,GHz band detectors, the pixel size is $2\times
2\mathrm{\,mm}^2$, to ensure a comparable sampling of the focal
plane. {\rev This results in a sampling slightly above $\lambda/D$ in
this channel, where $D$ is the diameter aperture, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:grid_distortion}.}
In order to ensure a full coverage of the 6.5' FOV, a total of
1,140 pixels are needed in each of the two 260\,GHz arrays A1 and A3. 

The key advantage of KID technology is the simplicity of the cold
electronics and the multiplexing scheme. In NIKA2, each block of around 150
detectors is connected to single coaxial line linked to the readout
electronics~\citep{Bourrion2016}. {\lp Therefore, Array 2 is connected to four
different readout feed-lines, while Arrays 1 $\&  $ 3 are both equipped with eight
feed-lines.}
The warm electronics required to digitise
and process the pixel signals is composed of twenty custom-built readout
cards (one per feed-line).

\subsection{KID photometry and {\tt tuning}}
\label{se:tuning}

Kinetic inductance detectors are superconducting resonators whose resonance
frequency shift linearly depends on the incoming optical power.
{\lp This was theoretically demonstrated in~\citet{Swenson2010} and
confirmed for NIKA KIDs, which have a similar design to the current
NIKA2 KIDs, using laboratory measurements, as discussed
in~\citet{Monfardini2014JLTP}.}
The measurement of the KID frequency shift $\Delta f$ is critical for the use of
KIDs as mm wave detectors. 

For the KID readout, an excitation signal is sent into the cryostat on the
feed-line coupled to the KID.
The excitation tones produced by the electronics are amplified by a
cryogenic (4\,K) low-noise amplifier after passing through the KIDs and
being analysed by the readout electronics. {\lp Each KID is thus
associated with an excitation tone at a frequency $f_{\rm{tone}}$, which
corresponds to an estimate of its resonance frequency for a reference
background optical load.}
The transmitted signal can be described by its
amplitude and phase, or, as is common practice for KID, by its $I$
(in-phase) and $Q$ (quadrature) components
with respect to the excitation signal.
The goal is now to relate the measured variations of the KID response
to the excitation signal $(\Delta I, \Delta Q)$, which are induced by incident light, to
$\Delta f$. For this, the electronics modulate the excitation tone
frequency $f_{\rm{tone}}$ at about 1\,kHz with a known frequency variation $\delta f,$
and the read out gives the induced transmitted signal variations
$(dI, dQ)$. Projecting linearly $(\Delta I, \Delta Q)$ on $(dI, dQ)$ therefore
provides $\Delta f$. This quantity, in Hz, constitutes the raw KID
time-ordered data, which are sampled at a frequency of
$23.84\,\rm{Hz}$. For historical reasons, this way of deriving KID
signals has been nicknamed \emph{RfdIdQ}. More details on this process
are given in \citet{Calvo2013}.
Once ingested into the calibration pipeline, the raw data will be further converted
into astronomical units (Sect.~\ref{se:calibration}).\\


In addition to light of astronomical origin, any change in the
background optical load (due, for example, to changes in
the atmospheric emission with elevation) also contributes to
the shift of the KID resonance frequencies. In
order to maximize the sensitivity of a KID, the excitation signal $f_{\rm{tone}}$
must always be near the KID resonance frequency. We therefore developed a tuning algorithm that performs this optimisation. A {\tt tuning} is performed at the beginning
of each observation scan to adapt the KIDs $f_{\rm{tone}}$ to the working background
conditions.
This process takes only a few seconds.
These optimal conditions are further maintained by performing
continuous {\tt tunings} between two scans while NIKA2 is not observing, to
match regularly with the observing conditions.

\subsection{Bandpasses}
\label{se:instru_bandpass}

\begin{figure}[ht!] % Inline image example
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[clip,trim={0, 1cm, 0, 2cm},width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/bandpasses_nika2_colorsok.png}
\caption[NIKA2 transmission]{Relative system response of three KID
  arrays as a
  function of frequency. For illustration, we also show (black)  the atmospheric transmission obtained with the ATM model \citep{ATM,
    Pardo2001} for two values of precipitable water vapour (1 and
  $5\,\rm{mm}$).
  The spectra of the model of Uranus (pink) and the model of
  Neptune
  (green), as discussed in Appendix~\ref{ap:ref_flux_calibrator}, are
  also plotted for illustration with arbitrary
  normalisation with respect to the NIKA2 transmission.} 
 \label{spectralband1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The NIKA2 spectral bands were measured in the laboratory using a
Martin-Puplett interferometer built in-house~\citep{Durand2007_these}.
The measurement relies on using the difference of two black
body radiations used as input signal for the interferometer. 
{\lp Both arrays and filter bands were considered in the
measurements, while the dichroic element was not included.}
Figure~\ref{spectralband1} shows the relative spectral response for
the three arrays. We highlight that Array 2 was
upgraded in September 2016 (during the so-called N2R5 technical campaign) and that
the spectral transmissions are slightly different (red and orange lines in
Fig.~\ref{spectralband1}).

The two arrays operating at 260 GHz, mapping different linear polarisations,
exhibit a slightly different spectral behaviour as can be
seen on Fig.~\ref{spectralband1}. {\lp Besides the effect of the
optical elements in front of the two arrays, this may be explained by
a tiny difference in the silicon wafer, the difference of the
aluminium film thickness of the KID arrays and/or the different
responses for two polarisations of the
detector~\citep{Adam2018, Shu2018_bandpass}.}

It is clear from Fig.~\ref{spectralband1} that the atmosphere may
modify the overall transmission of the system, especially at the
transmission tails for A2. {\lp To highlight this effect, we compute an effective
frequency $\nu_{\rm{eff}}$ computed as the weighted integral of the
frequency considering the NIKA2 bandpass and the SED of Uranus, for
various atmospheric conditions.}
In Table~\ref{tab:frequencies}, we give $\nu_{\rm{eff}}$ and the
bandwidths $\Delta \nu$ computed both at zero atmospheric opacity and for the
reference IRAM \trentemetre\ winter semester observing conditions
(defined by an atmospheric content of $2\,\rm{mm}$ of precipitable
water vapour (pwv) and an observing elevation of $60^o$).

\begin{table}[!htbp]
  \caption[]{Effective frequencies $\nu_{\rm{eff}}$ and bandwidths

  \label{tab:frequencies}
  \centering    
  \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \hline\hline
    \noalign{\smallskip}
    & Array 1 & Array 3 & Array 2 \\

    $\nu_{\rm{eff}}$ \small{(2mm, 60deg)} [GHz] & 254.2 & 257.1 &  150.6 \\
    $\Delta \nu$ \small{(2mm, 60deg)} [GHz] &  48.7 &  47.9 &    39.2 \\
    \noalign{\smallskip}
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

{\lp In the laboratory, spectral characterisation allows the bandpass of the
three arrays to be measured with uncertainties better than one
percent. The bandpass characterisation will be further improved using
\emph{in-situ} measurements with a new Martin-Puplett interferometer designed
to be placed in front of the cryostat window, making it possible to
account for the whole optical system, including the dichroic plate. As discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:calibration}, the \emph{baseline} calibration method
only resorts to the bandpass measurements for colour correction
estimations in order to mitigate the bandpass uncertainty propagation
in the flux density measurement.}
In fact, for each array, we define reference frequencies 
to define NIKA2 photometric system. These are 260~GHz for the A1 and A3, and
150~GHz for A2.

%       3./ Observing mode
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Observations}
\label{se:observations}
%\input{Observations.tex}

This section presents the different observation modes that are used at
the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope for both commissioning and
scientific-purpose observations with NIKA2. {\lp Each observation
campaign is organised as an observing pool allowing the optimisation of
observations of several science targets in a flexible way.}
Most of these observing scans are on-the-fly (OTF) raster scans,
which consist of a series of scans at constant azimuth or elevation
(right ascension or declination) and varying elevation or azimuth
(declination or right ascension).
Their characteristics are tailored for NIKA2 performance.


\subsection{Focus}
\label{se:axial_focus}

Observation pools start by setting the telescope focus since NIKA2's large
FOV alleviates the need to adjust the pointing beforehand.  
We designed a specific focus procedure that takes
advantage of the dense sampling of the FOV making it possible to map a source
in a short integration time. We performed a series of five successive one-minute
raster scans of a bright (above a few Jy) point source at five
axial offsets of the secondary mirror (M2) along the optical
axis. As the scan size is $1'\times 5'$, the main contribution to each
map mainly comes from the KIDs located in the central part of the FOV.

Elliptical Gaussian fits on the five maps provide estimates of
the flux and FWHM along minor and major axes for each focus. 
The best axial focus in the central part of the array is then
estimated as the maximum of the flux or the minimum of the FWHM using
parabolic fits of the five measurements.

As presented in more detail in Appendix~\ref{ap:focus_surfaces}, the focus
surface, which is defined as the locations of the best focus across the whole FOV
is not flat, but rather slightly bowl-shaped.
To account for the curvature of the focus surfaces and optimise the
average focus across the FOV, we add -0.2\,mm to the best axial focus
in the central part of the array. This focus offset is measured on data using
a dedicated sequence of de-focused scans, as discussed in
Appendix~\ref{ap:focus_surfaces}. It is in agreement with expectations
derived with optical simulation using ZEMAX\footnote{Web site: \tt{www.zemax.com}}. 

{\lp Axial focus offsets are \LEt{were? Or is it ongoing?}measured every other hour during daytime and
are systematically checked after sunrises and sunsets, while one or
two checks suffice during the night. 
Lateral focus offsets can also be checked in a similar way, but are
found to stay constant over periods of time that cover several
observing campaigns.}


\subsection{Pointing}
\label{se:pointing}
% + RTA pointing estimate method
% + pointing model
% + pointing error (scan-to-scan scattering)

Once the instrument was correctly focused, we were able to\LEt{? Please remember to review tenses throughout} estimate pointing corrections
before scientific observations.
Based on general operating experience at the \trentemetre\ telescope, we use the so-called
{\tt pointing} or {\tt cross-type} scans to monitor the pointing during observations. The
telescope executes a back and forth scan in azimuth and a back and forth scan in
elevation, centred on the observed source. We fit Gaussian profiles
from the timelines of the reference detector, which is chosen as a
valid detector located close to the centre of Array 2. {The choice of
a reference detector operated at $150\,\rm{GHz}$ is suitable since most
of our pointing sources are radio sources.} We use the
estimated position of the reference detector to derive the current pointing
offsets of the system in azimuth and elevation. This correction is
propagated to the following scans. The pointing is monitored in an
hourly basis.

{\lp In addition, we perform \emph{pointing sessions} in order to
refine NIKA2 pointing model. A pointing session consists of observing
about 30 sources on a wide range of elevations and azimuth angles while
monitoring the pointing offsets that are measured for each
observation. During the N2R9 technical campaign, the rms of
the residual scatter after pointing offset correction was $1.62''$ in
azimuth and $1.37''$ in elevation. We conservatively report rms pointing errors $<3''$.}

\subsection{Skydip}
\label{se:skydip}

A skydip scan consists of a step-by-step sky scan along a large range
of elevations.
{\lp NIKA2 skydips are not used for the scan-to-scan atmospheric 
calibration. For this purpose, the KIDs are used as total power
detectors to estimate the emission of the atmosphere and hence, the
atmospheric opacity, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:opacity}. 
NIKA2 skydips therefore serve to calibrate the KID responses with
respect to the atmospheric background for atmospheric opacity
derivation.}

Unlike heterodyne receivers for which skydips can be
conducted continuously slewing the telescope in elevation, the NIKA2
camera cannot resort to such method, as the KIDs need to be retuned
for a given \airmass. A NIKA2 skydip, which is quoted {\tt skydip},
comprises 11 steps in the elevation range from 19 to 65 degrees,
regularly spaced in \airmass. For each step, we acquire about twenty
seconds of data to ensure a precise measurements. The KIDs are tuned at
the beginning of each constant elevation sub-scan (hence once per
\airmass).

{\tt Skydips} {\lp are typically performed every eight hours for a wide spanning
of the atmospheric conditions through an observation campaign.\LEt{Single-sentence paragraphs are not permitted. Could we join this onto the previous one?}} 


\subsection{Beam map}
\label{se:beammaps}

A \bm\ scan is a raster scan in ($\az$, $\elev$) coordinates tailored to map a
bright compact source, often a planet, with steps of 4.8'', which are
small enough
{\rev to ensure a half-beam sampling, which gives around 90\% fidelity, for
each KID.} 
A scan of 
$13\times7.8$~arcmin$^2$ is acquired either with the telescope
performing a series of continuous slews at fixed elevation or at fixed azimuth. 
A continuous scanning slew defines a sub-scan. 
The fixed-elevation scanning has the advantage of suppressing the air-mass variation
across a sub-scan, while the fixed-azimuth scanning offers an
orthogonal scan direction to the former:
the combination of both gives a more accurate determination of the far side
lobes.
The scan size is optimised to enable maps to be made for all
KIDs, even those located at the edges of the array. A larger size in the scanning
direction allows for correlated noise subtraction.
During sub-scans, the telescope moves at
65\,arcsec/s\LEt{Please be cautious in the use of the slash. This sign is used first and foremost to indicate a ratio and secondly to replace or. Please check for this throughout to avoid misinterpretation. For details, refer to Sect. 3.6 of Language Guide. (https://www.aanda.org/for-authors/language-editing/1-introduction) }.
{\rev The need to have a high-fidelity sampling of 11'' beams 
along the scan direction translates into a maximum speed of
97\,arcsec/s, which ensures 2.7 samples per beam, for our nominal
acquisition rate of 23.8\,Hz,} and is thus met with margins. For the
sake of scanning efficiency with the \trentemetre\ telescope, the minimal duration for
subscans is 10\,s. For \bm\ scans,
sub-scans last 12 s, and the entire scan lasts about 25\,min.

{\tt Beammaps} are key observations for the calibration. {\lp While
a single \bm\ acquired in stable observing conditions could suffice,
\bm\ scans are performed on a daily basis.}
More details on these observations are given in Sect.~\ref{se:geometry}
where we describe how to actually exploit them to derive individual KID
properties.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%       4./ Data reduction
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Data Reduction: from raw data to flux density maps}
\label{se:dataproc}
%\input{Pipeline.tex}

The raw KID data ($I$, $Q$, $\Delta I$, $\Delta Q$) and the telescope
source-tracking data are synchronised by the NIKA2 acquisition system using a
clock that gives the absolute astronomical time, which is the telescope
pulses per second, to define the NIKA2 raw data. From the KID raw
data, we compute a quantity that is proportional to the KID
frequency shift using the \emph{RfdIdQ} method, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:tuning}. This quantity, which is hence proportional to
the input signal, constitutes the KID time-ordered information (TOI).

We have developed a dedicated data reduction pipeline to
produce calibrated sky maps from NIKA2 raw data. This pipeline was first 
developed for the data analysis during the commissioning campaigns and
is currently used for scientific data reduction. The calibration
and performance assessment relies on this pipeline. 
A detailed description of this software is to be presented in a companion
paper \citep{Ponthieu2019}, as well as an application to blind source
detection. Here, we summarise the main steps of the data
reduction. {\lp Moreover, we focus the discussion on the treatment of
point-like or compact sources, which are used for the
performance assessment.}

\subsection{Low level processing}
\label{se:ll_proc}
We isolate the relevant fraction of the data for scientific
utilisation and {\lp we mask KIDs that do not meet the selection criteria, as
discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:avg_kidpar},} or
timeline accidents (glitches). Specifically, we flag out cosmic rays,
which impact only one data sample per hit due to the KID fast time
constant~\citep{Catalano2014},
and the KIDs for which the noise level exceed $3\sigma$ of the average
noise level of all other KIDs of the same array.  

\subsection{Pointing reconstruction}
\label{se:ptg}
We produce a timeline of the pointing positions of each KID with
respect to the targeted source position (usually located at the centre of the
scan) using two sets of information. Firstly, the control system of the
telescope provides us with the absolute pointing of a reference point
of the focal point, which is coincident with the reference KID after
the pointing correction are applied, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:pointing}. Secondly, we estimate the offset positions of
each KID with respect to the reference KID using a dedicated
procedure, referred to as the focal plane reconstruction, as
presented in Sect.~\ref{se:geometry}. After this step, we are able to
distinguish KIDs that are on-source from those that are off-source,
which is a key piece of information for dealing with the correlated noise. 
  
\subsection{TOI calibration}
\label{se:flux_calib}
The KID TOI in units of Hz (frequency shifts) is converted to
Jy/beam in two steps. Firstly, the KID data are inter-calibrated using the
calibration coefficients, also known as\ relative gains, 
as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field}, and the
absolute scale of the flux density is set using the absolute
calibration method discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:calibration_method}. Secondly, the instantaneous line-of-sight
atmospheric attenuation $\rm{exp}[{-\taunu x(t)}]$ is corrected
using the zenith opacity at the observing frequency $\nu$ $\taunu$, which is estimated for a given scan
as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:opacity}, and the instantaneous \airmass\
$x(t)$. {\lp The latter is estimated as $(\sin \elev_t)^{-1}$ using the observing elevation
$\elev_t$, as obtained using the pointing reconstruction.}     

\subsection{Correlated noise subtraction}
\label{se:toi_proc}
The TOI of each KID includes a prominent low-frequency component of correlated noise of two
different origins: the atmospheric component, which is dominant
{\lp with some rare exceptions} and common to all KIDs, and the electronic noise, which is common to the KIDs connected
to a same electronic readout feed-line (see
Sect.~\ref{se:array}). The subtraction of this correlated noise is a key
step of the data processing, as correlated noise residuals are an
important limiting factor of the sensitivity. We have devised several
dedicated methods for this purpose. This is to be thoroughly
discussed in \citet{Ponthieu2019}, while here we illustrate the
general principle and only discuss the method routinely used for
the calibration.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}

  \cm\ that is subtracted from it (in red). {\lp The zero level is arbitrary.}}
\label{fig:nika_toi}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

As illustrated on the upper panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:nika_toi}, the
low-frequency noise component is seen by all KIDs at the same time,
while the astrophysical signal {\lp (Uranus in this case)} is shifted
from one KID to another.
{\lp In this figure the KID TOIs have been rescaled to be null
at $t=0$.} 
A simple average of the KID TOIs provides an
estimate of the low-frequency noise component, which we referred to as
a \emph{common mode}, while the signal is averaged out. The common
mode shown as a red line on the lower panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:nika_toi} is then subtracted to each KID TOI.

  \label{rmspws}}
\end{figure}

{\lp For the calibration and performance assessment, we use an
atmospheric and electronic noise
de-correlation method named \cmoneb,\, which comprises two
additional technicalities with respect to the common mode
method.} Firstly, the signal contamination of the common mode estimate
is mitigated by discarding on-source KID data samples before averaging
the rescaled TOI. {\rev This is achieved by deriving a mask per TOI
from the pointing information (Sect.~\ref{se:ptg}), which is zero if
the KID is close to the source, and equal to unity otherwise. In the case of a
point source, the mask consists of a disk of a minimum radius of 60''
centred on the source, whereas for diffuse emission, tailored masks
driven by the source morphology are built using iterative methods, like
for example, in~\citet{Ruppin2017}.}
Secondly, instead of a single common mode subtraction for
all KIDs, we estimate an accurate common mode for each
KID. Calculating the KID-to-KID cross-correlation matrix, we
identify the most correlated KIDs. Then, we build an
inverse noise weighted co-addition of the timelines of the %off-source
KIDs that are the most correlated with the KID in question. Furthermore, we tested on simulations that this method
does preserve the flux of {\lp point-like or moderately extended
sources.}

{\rev Regarding diffuse emission, the noise de-correlation induces a
filtering effect at large angular scales that must be corrected
for to fully recover the large scale signal. A method to correct for the
spatial filtering, which relies on the evaluation of the data
processing transfer function using simulations, is
described in~\citet{Adam2015}. The data processing transfer function
depends on the morphological properties of the concerned extended source. 
An example of the data processing transfer function for
NIKA2 observation towards a galaxy cluster is given
in~\citet{Ruppin2018}, evidencing a prominent filtering at
angular scales larger than the 6.5' diameter FOV.} 

In Fig.~\ref{rmspws}, we present the noise power spectra of
a typical KID TOI, both before any data reduction and using three noise
de-correlation methods, which are the simple common mode (CM) method
used in Fig.~\ref{fig:nika_toi}, a method based on a principal component
analysis (PCA), and the \cmoneb\ method (MCP). We observe that after de-correlation, the
$1/f$-like noise in the power spectra (principally due to atmospheric
emission drifts)
is significantly reduced, leading to nearly flat spectra down to {\lp
0.5~Hz}, with lower $1/f$-like residual noise for the PCA and
the \cmoneb\ methods than the common mode de-correlation at low
frequencies. {\rev The two former methods further subtract a
substantial fraction of the correlated noise that originates from the
electronic readouts.} {\lp Moreover, we used simulations to check that
the \cmoneb\ method was more efficient than the PCA in preserving the
astrophysical signal. The former is thus preferred over the latter.} 

\subsection{Map projection}
\label{se:map_projection}
We use the pointing information to project the cleaned (low-frequency
noise subtracted) calibrated TOI of all the valid KIDs of an array
onto a flux density map (tangential projection). This map $M_p$ is produced using an inverse
variance noise weighting of all of the data samples that fall into a map
pixel as defined using a nearest grid point scheme. We also compute
the associated count map $H_p$ defined as the number of data samples
per map pixels. The map resolution
is chosen small enough (typically $2''$ per map pixel) to alleviate
the need for more refined interpolation scheme. The noise variance
$\sigma_k$ for each KID $k$ is evaluated by the standard deviation of the
KID TOI far from the source position. 
%nk_w8.pro in nk_scan_reduce.pro
%nk_projection_4.pro
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\lp The variance map $\sigma_p^2$ is inhomogeneous and varies as the
inverse of $H_p$. Its normalisation is evaluated using the
homogeneous background map variance, that is the
variance of $M_p\sqrt{H_p}$ calculated far from the source.}
%nk_bg_var_map
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

{\lp To account for the residual
correlated noise while evaluating the variance map, we resort to an
effective approach.
Firstly, we compute the map of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the ratio of
$M_p$ and the noise map $\sigma_p$, that is the square root of the
variance map. We observe that the distribution of the SNR map over the pixels far from the source is
well-approximated with a Gaussian, but has a width larger than the
expected unity. This is due to the remaining correlations between KID TOIs
before projection. Then, we multiply the noise map 
$\sigma_p$ by the required factor so
that the width of SNR distribution becomes normalised.
This normalising factor ranges from 1.2 to 1.5 depending on the observing conditions. This
constitutes an effective approach to account for the pixel-to-pixel
correlation matrix of off-diagonal terms, alleviating the need to
accurately measure them\LEt{I wasn't certain of your meaning here, so please check carefully for clarity}.}

When several scans of the same source are averaged, we apply an inverse
variance weighting as well. 
The variance map of the sum of scans is also corrected to ensure unity-width
SNR distribution.

\subsection{Observation scan selection}
\label{se:data_selection}

For calibration and performance assessment, we select scans in average
observing conditions by performing mild selection cuts. These scan
cuts rely on zenith opacity estimates $\taunu$ in NIKA2 bands, as
described in Sect.~\ref{se:opacity}, on the elevation and on the
observation time of the day. We select the scans satisfying the
following criteria:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item[i)] $\tau_{\rm{A_3}} < 0.5$, where $\tau_{\rm{A_3}}$ is the $\taunu$ estimate for
  Array 3; 
\item[ii)] $x\, \tau_{\rm{A_3}} < 0.7$ and $\elev > 20^{o}$, where
$\elev$ is the observing elevation and $x$ the
  \airmass, which depends on the elevation as $x=(\sin{\elev})^{-1}$. This
  threshold corresponds to a decrease of the astrophysical signal by a
  factor of two;
\item[iii)] observation time from 22:00 to 9:00 UT and from 10:00 to
  15:00 UT, which excludes the sunrise period and the late afternoon.
\end{itemize}
%
{\lp In the following sections, these selection cuts are referred to as the 
'\emph{baseline} scan selection'.}  
As discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}, the late afternoon
observations are often affected by time-variable broadening of the
telescope beams caused by (partial) solar irradiation of the primary
mirror and/or anomalous atmospheric refraction.
Around sunrise, the focus shifts continuously due to the ambient temperature
change until the temperature stabilises, so the scans taken from
9:00 to 10:00 UT are likely not to be optimally focused.
After the focus stabilisation, the middle of the day period ranging
from 10:00 to 15:00 UT offers stable observing conditions
provided that the telescope is not pointed too
close to the Sun.
Otherwise, further scan selection based on
the exact sequence of observations and on beam monitoring might be
needed before using these observations for performance assessment.
{\lp In summary, the \emph{baseline} scan selection retains 16 hours of
observations a day and discards observations affected by an
atmospheric absorption exceeding 100\%.}

\section{Focal Plane Reconstruction}
\label{se:geometry}
%\input{FOV_Geometry.tex}

{\lp From the operational point-of-view, the KIDs are defined by the
resonance frequency and not by their physical position in the focal
plane. Therefore, to find the position on the sky, we need to deploy
a dedicated method that we refer to as the FOV reconstruction.}
The FOV reconstruction thus consists if matching the KID frequency tones
to positions in the sky and performing a KID selection.
Although all of the 2,900 KID are responsive, some of them are affected by
cross talk or are noisy due to an inaccurate tuning of their
frequencies, and must be discarded for further analysis. We use \bms,
which enable an individual map per KID to be constructed %, as discussed in
%Sect.~\ref{se:beammaps},
to measure the KID positions and relative gains, as
discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:fov_geometry}. The measured KID positions
are further
checked by matching them with the design positions, as presented in
Sect.~\ref{se:grid_distortion}. In Sect.~\ref{se:avg_kidpar}, we
present the final KID selection and FOV geometry, as obtained by
repeating the procedure on a series of \bms.  



%   Methods
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Reconstruction of the FOV positions and KID properties}
\label{se:fov_geometry}

In order to be able to produce a map, one needs to associate a pointing
direction to any data sample of the system. The telescope provides
pointing information for a reference position in the focal
plane. This information consists of the
absolute azimuth and elevation $(\az_t^{\rm{ref}},\elev_t^{\rm{ref}})$
of the source, together with offsets
$(\Delta\az_t^{\rm{ref}}, \Delta\elev_t^{\rm{ref}})$ with respect to~these{\lp, which 
depend on the scanning strategy.}
We then need to know the relative pointing offsets of each detector
with respect to this reference position. We use
\bms\ for this purpose (see Sect.~\ref{se:beammaps}).

We apply a median filter per KID timeline for which the width is set to 31
samples, that is equivalent to about five~FWHM at 65\,arcsec/s and for the
sampling frequency of
23.84\,Hz. Then, we project one map per KID in Nasmyth
coordinates. The median filter efficiently removes most of the low frequency atmospheric and electronic
noise, albeit with a slight ringing and flux loss on the
source. However, at this stage, we are only interested in the location
of the observed source.
To derive the Nasmyth coordinates from the
provided $(\az_t,\elev_t)$ and $(\Delta\az_t,\Delta\elev_t)$
coordinates, we build the following quantities at time~$t$:

\begin{equation}
\left( {\begin{array}{c}
\Delta x_t\\
\Delta y_t \\
\end{array}} \right) = 
\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
\cos\elev_t & - \sin\elev_t  \\
\sin \elev_t & \cos \elev_t \\
\end{array}} \right)
\left( {\begin{array}{c}
\Delta \az_t^{\rm{ref}}\\
\Delta \elev_t^{\rm{ref}} \\
\end{array}} \right).
\end{equation}

We note that $\Delta\az_t^{\rm{ref}}$ is already corrected by the $\cos\elev_t^{\rm{ref}}$ factor to
have orthonormal coordinates in the tangent plane of the sky and to be immune to
the geodesic convergence at the poles.
The data timelines are then projected onto $(x,\, y)$ maps. 
We fit a 2D elliptical Gaussian on each KID Nasmyth map. {\lp The centroid
position of this Gaussian provides us with an estimate of the KID
pointing offsets with respect to\ the telescope reference position
($\az_t+\Delta\az_t$, $\elev_t+\Delta\elev_t$) in Nasmyth
$(x,y)$ coordinates (independent of time).

To convert from Nasmyth offsets to $(\az,\elev)$ offsets, we apply the
following rotation:
%
\begin{equation}
\left( {\begin{array}{c}
\Delta \az^k_t\\
\Delta \elev^k_t\\
\end{array}} \right) = 
\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
\cos\elev_t & \sin\elev_t  \\
-\sin \elev_t & \cos \elev_t \\
\end{array}} \right)
\left( {\begin{array}{c}
\Delta x^k\\
\Delta y^k\\
\end{array}} \right),
\end{equation}
%
where $k$ is a KID index. Adding these offsets to
$(\Delta \az_t^{\rm{ref}}, \Delta \elev_t^{\rm{ref}})$ gives the
absolute pointing of each KID in these coordinates.}

{\lp Furthermore, the fitted Gaussian per KID further provides us with
a first estimate of the KID FWHM, ellipticity and sensitivity. 
We apply an initial KID selection by removing outliers to the statistics
on these parameters. We also manually discard KIDs that show a
cross-talk counterpart on their map. We repeat this
procedure using the \emph{baseline} TOI de-correlation method instead of the
median filter. Specifically, we apply the \cmoneb\ noise subtraction
presented in Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc} to the KID timelines, which are
then used to produce maps per KID. This therefore alleviates the flux loss
induced by the median filter.}
{\rev This also ensures that the \bms\ are treated in the same way as
the scientific observation scans are.} Finally, a second iteration of
the KID selection is performed.
This analysis is repeated on all \bms\ to obtain statistics and
precision on each KID parameter, together with estimates on KID
performance stability, as discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{FOV grid distortion}
\label{se:grid_distortion}

We compare the reconstructed KID positions in the FOV to their design
positions in the array. We fit the 2D field translation and rotation that make it possible to
match the measured KID positions with the design positions using a 2D
polynomial mapping function. {\lp We find that a match can be
obtained using a 2D polynomial function of degree one, which corresponds to a linear
transformation and a rotation only.} We call distortion cross-terms
between the two spatial coordinates in the polynomial fit.

The aim is twofold. Firstly, we obtain a detailed
characterisation of the real geometry of NIKA2 focal plane. Secondly,
{\lp this analysis is also used for KID
selection}. The most deviant KIDs, of which the measured position deviates
by more than $4''$ from the design position, are discarded. 

We present the global results of the grid distortion
analysis using the KID positions given
by the focal plane geometry procedure, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:fov_geometry}, applied to a \bm\ scan acquired
during the first scientific campaign (also known as\ N2R12). 
The initial
number of KIDs considered in this analysis results from
an initial KID selection, which consists of discarding the KIDs that are the most
impacted by the cross-talk effect or the {\tt tuning} failures,
applied in the FOV geometry obtained from the \bm\ scan. More details
on the KID selection are given in the next section. %Sect.~\ref{se:avg_kidpar}.
The results are gathered in Table~\ref{ta:gridmatch}.

Most of the selected KIDs are also well-placed, meaning fewer than 4'' away from
their expected position. Moreover, on average, the position of each
detector is known to about one arcsecond. We find
that Array 1 has some of the most deviant detectors (more than 4''
from their expected position). These detectors are excluded from
further analysis. The two 1-mm arrays have almost
the same centre, but this centre differs by $7''$ and $2''$ in the two Nasmyth
coordinates, respectively, from the 2-mm array centre.
This has no significant impact on the pointing and the focus settings
at the precision of which they are measured.
{\lp The centre-to-centre distance between
contiguous detectors, referred to as grid step, has been estimated in
$mm$ and arcseconds.\LEt{Sometimes you use arcsec, sometimes arcesconds, could we choose one for consistency?} The ratio of the grid step in mm to
the grid step in arcseconds gives compatible effective focal lengths
of about $42.4\pm0.3\,\rm{m}$ at both observing wavelengths.} The sampling is above $\lambda/D$ at
1\,mm, assuming a 27-m effective diameter aperture. We note that
the rotation angle between the array and the Nasmyth
coordinates was designed as $76.2^{\rm{o}}$, fewer than two degrees
away from what is observed.


These results have been compared to expectations obtained using ZEMAX
simulation. 
We generated a grid diagram for the NIKA2 optical system and found a maximum
grid distortion of $2.7\%$ in the $6.5'$ FOV. We notice that the
strongest distortion appears in the upper-right corner of the Nasmyth plane, which is
also the area of the largest defocus in relation to the centre (see Appendix~\ref{ap:focus_surfaces}).
An expected distortion of $2.7\%$ is at most a 5'' shift from the
centre to the outside of the array. The quoted distortions between the
measured and design positions are well within the expected
maximum distortions from the NIKA2 optics.

\subsection{KID selection and average geometry}
\label{se:avg_kidpar}

In order to identify the most stable KIDs, we compare the KID parameters
obtained using the FOV reconstruction procedure, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:fov_geometry}, with several \bms. In the following, we
show the results as obtained using {\lp ten} \bms\ acquired during two
technical observation campaigns in 2017.
For each KID, we compute the average position on the focal plane and
the average FWHM. 
As discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:fov_geometry}, we perform a KID
selection while analysing \bms. A few KIDs have very close resonance
frequencies and can be misidentified on some scans. A few others must
also be discarded because they appear
numerically identical due to the fact that the same (noisy) KID can sometimes be
associated with two different frequency tones in the acquisition system.
These KIDs are flagged out (less than 1\% of the design KIDs).
{\lp We count how many times a KID has been kept in
the KID selection per \bm\ and has been found at a position in agreement
with its median position within 4''.}
Using this, we define the {\emph valid} KIDs as the KIDs that met the selection
criteria in about {\lp $20\%$} of the FOV geometries (in two \bm\
analyses out of ten).

In Fig.~\ref{fig:avg_fov_color}, we show the average focal plane
reconstruction. The colours, from blue to red,
represent the number of times that the KID has been retained after
KID selection. The eight feed lines for each of the two
$1\,\rm{-mm}$ arrays {\lp can also be traced out in several ways} in this
figure. Firstly, slightly larger spaces are seen between KID rows
connected to different feed lines than between KID rows of the same
feed line. Secondly, KIDs at the end of a feed line are valid less often than the others
(see e.g. the FOV of Array 3). As the tone frequencies
increase with the position of the KID in the feed line, some KIDs are
sometimes missing because their frequency lays above the maximum tone
frequency authorised by the readout electronics. This explains the
linear holes in the middle of the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ arrays. For A1, this
end-of-feed-line effect is mixed with the effect of the KID gain
variation across the FOV, which mainly affects the lower-left third of
the array, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field}.

For A1, A3, and A2, respectively, we found 952, 961, and 553 valid KIDs
 (selected at least twice). From this, we deduce the fraction of
valid detectors over the design ones, as given in Table~\ref{tab:number_of_kids}.


\begin{table}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \caption[Number of detectors]{Summary of the number of valid detectors per array.}
    \label{tab:number_of_kids}  
    \begin{tabular}{lrrr}

      \hline

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}    
\end{table}


The valid KIDs represent the KIDs
that are usable to produce a scientifically exploitable map of the flux
density using observations for which no sizeable {\tt tuning}
issues are experienced. 
{\lp To give an idea of the dependence of the KID selection on the
observing conditions,} we also
evaluate a number of \emph{very stable} KIDs, such as the KIDs that met the
selection criteria in at least {\lp $50\%$} of the FOV geometries (at least
five times out of {\lp ten}). We
found 840, 868, and 508 KIDs using this definition for A1, A3, and A2,
respectively. The fraction of very stable KIDs over the designed ones
is reported in Table.~\ref{tab:eta_used}.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \caption[]{Fraction of \emph{very stable} KIDs (percent) of the design

  the median fraction of used KIDs in the data reduction processing
  after the conservative KID selection was performed (see Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc})}
  \label{tab:eta_used}
  \begin{tabular}{llrrrr}

               & Combined & 70 &  69  & 78 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For the practical production of flux density maps, we perform
a further selection of the valid KIDs using a conservative noise level
threshold of the KIDs at the \emph{low-level processing}, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}. The number of \emph{used} KIDs for producing
scientific maps using the data reduction pipeline, as described
in Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}, is thus significantly lower than the number of
\emph{valid} KIDs. We evaluate the median number of used KIDs using all scans
for each of the observation campaigns. The median fractions of used
KIDs with respect to the design ones for each campaign and for the
combinations of all scans are given in Table.~\ref{tab:eta_used}. We
find median fractions of used KIDs of about $70\%$ for the
$1\, \rm{-mm}$ arrays, and of about $80\%$ for the $2\, \rm{-mm}$ array,
with a notable exception at the N2R9 technical campaign, for which
these fractions are lower due to severe {\lp atmospheric} temperature-induced
unstable observing conditions (see
Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}). Moreover, the median fractions of used
KIDs are close to the fractions of
\emph{very stable} KIDs from the FOV geometries. We stress that these numbers
depend on the choices made in the data reduction pipeline for data
sample cuts, and are thus subject to improvement. By contrast, the
fractions of valid KIDs $\eta$ constitute conservative estimates of the
stable KIDs usable for scientific exploitation over all the functioning
KIDs. These are thus the relevant estimates for the instrument
performance assessment.

\section{Beam pattern}
\label{se:beam}
%\input{Beam.tex}

{\lp The NIKA2 full-beam pattern originates from the KIDs illuminating the internal
and external optics, out to the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope primary mirror.}
To characterise the full-beam pattern, we use \bm\ observations. Firstly,
deep integration maps of bright sources are produced to provide a
qualitative description of the complex beam structure in
Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam}. Then, we model the beam using three
complementary methods to estimate the main-beam angular resolution
(Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam}) and the beam efficiency
(Sect.~\ref{se:beam_efficiency}).

\subsection{Full-beam pattern}
\label{se:fullbeam}

To study the 2D pattern of the beam, we 
primarily used\LEt{?? Reminder to check tenses throughout. Is this your method? Or  a common fact...?} a map obtained from a combination of \bm\ observations
of strong point sources acquired during the N2R9 commissioning campaign.
%N2R8 and N2R9 technical campaigns.
Namely, we use \bm\ scans of Uranus%(scan id '20170125s223' and '20170125s243')
,  Neptune, %('20170224s177')
and the bright quasar 3C84. %('20170226s415').
Furthermore, we checked the stability of our results on single scan
maps, combinations of scans for a single source, and combinations of
shallower scans that span a large range of scanning direction. {\lp
The \bm\ scans are reduced using the method discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc} to produce maps.}
{\lp Figure~\ref{fig:features} shows the 2D beam pattern
as measured with NIKA2 using the former \bm\ combination, for each of
the arrays and for the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ array combination.}
{\lp The beam pattern is shown over a large dynamic range down
to about $-40\,\rm{dB}$ and out to radii of about 5’.
The telescope beam pattern further extends well beyond this radius, as for
example, shown by lunar edge observations
%with heterodyne front-ends installed
at the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope~\citep{Greve1998,
Kramer2013}. However,
this extended pattern is at present difficult to detect using the data
reduction pipeline discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}, as
the extended error beams are both filtered and mixed with 
atmospheric and electronics large-scale correlated noise
residuals. {\rev We expect the filtering effect caused by the data
processing to become non-negligible for angular scales larger than
90'', which corresponds to the radial size of the mask used in the
correlated noise subtraction process (see Sect.~\ref{se:toi_proc}).}
The contributions to the beam pattern that stem from larger angular scales are
further discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_efficiency}.}

bright point-like sources, are in horizontal coordinates. {\rev They
represent a zoom in the inner part of larger maps that cover a
sky area which extends over $10'$.} 
The solid lines and arrows highlight some noticeable features.

\label{fig:features}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The NIKA2 beam maps reveal some noticeable features, which are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:features}. Ranging from strong and/or extended to
weak and/or spiky, they include the following points:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The main beam and the underlying first error
  beam, which is caused by large-scale deformations of the primary
  mirror, and the first side lobes, {\lp which correspond to various diffraction
  patterns. In particular, the 60'' and 85'' diameter (square-shaped) side
  lobes at $1$ and $2\,\rm{mm}$, respectively, at a level lower than
  $-20\,\rm{dB}$, are due to the convolution of the primary mirror and the
  quadrupod diffraction pattern with the pixel (KID) transfer function.}
\item At a much lower level of about $-30\,\rm{dB}$, a diffraction ring shows    
up, which is presumably caused by panel buckling of the primary 
  mirror~\citep{Greve2010}, as shown with a red circle in the A1 panel.
\item Also at a level of about $-30\,\rm{dB}$, the side lobes shown via green
  diagonal lines in the A2 panel are caused by diffraction on the
  quadrupod holding the secondary mirror of the telescope, as is expected
  from ZEMAX simulations.  
\item Spikes for which the origin is not fully understood are marked by yellow
  arrows. The ones that are along the vertical and
  horizontal axes are reproduced by ZEMAX simulations but at a 
  shallower level, whereas the ones shown in the A3 panel in the
  diagonal directions may be due to the small cylindrical
  instrumentation box on the side of the M2 cabin. The origin of the
  asymmetry on the 1-mm arrays is unknown, but most probably due to
  internal optics aberrations.
\item Shallow spikes of unknown origin at a level under $-30\,\rm{dB}$ that are circled by pink
  ellipses. The multiple images on the combined deep beam map indicate
  a rotation of these spikes with the observing elevation, which in
  turn point to diffraction-related issues or a ghost image
  formed inside the cryostat. These shallow features are expected to
  have no significant impact on NIKA2's scientific results.
\end{enumerate}

We further quantify the respective level of the axi-symmetrical
features of the beam pattern by evaluating the beam radial profile
$B_\nu(r)$, which is the normalised radial brightness profile for the
array $\nu$, where $r$ is the radius from the beam centre.
Although the profile cannot represent the sub-dominant non-axisymmetrical
features, which are seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:features} (quadrupod
diffraction pattern, spikes), it provides a useful
representation of the internal and central parts of the beam {\lp up to
 about $180''$.} We determine a beam profile from a beam map in centring to
the fitted value of the main-beam centre and in computing the
weighted average of the map pixels in annular rings.

We checked the stability of the beam against various
observing conditions (source intensity, weather conditions, focus
optimisation) by comparing the beam profiles of a series of 18 \bm\
observations.
This set of \bms, which is referred to as {\tt BM18}, has been
selected from all the available \bm\ scans at optimal focus using the
baseline scan selection criteria (Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}).
The measured beam profiles using the {\tt BM18} data set are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:beam_prof}. {\lp The profiles consist of the main beam and
the first error beams and side lobes, which significantly contribute
at levels of less than $-10\,\rm{dB}$ at both observing
wavelengths. Moreover, at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ the contribution of the
diffraction ring, which was marked with a red circle in Fig.~\ref{fig:features},
is seen as a peak at a level up to $-33\,\rm{dB}$ located at a radius
of about $115''$.} Calculating the {\lp rms of the relative}
difference of the beam profiles to the median beam profile, we find a
dispersion below $5\%$ at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ and below $2\%$ at
$2\,\rm{mm}$.

{\lp To measure the relative level of the axi-symmetrical beam pattern
features, we further model the beam profiles using an empirical function,
which accounts for the main beam and for a significant fraction of the
error beams and the side lobes. We define this function $B_{3G}(r)$ as:
\begin{equation}
  B_{3G}(r) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \mathcal{A}_i G_i(r) + \mathcal{B}_0,
  \label{eq:3gauss}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{A}_i$ is the amplitude of the Gaussian $G_i$ for
$i \in {1, 2, 3,}$ and $\mathcal{B}_0$ at\LEt{?} pedestal level accounting for
the residual background level in the map. The measured beam profiles
are fitted using Eq.~\ref{eq:3gauss}, and the median best-fit
parameters are given in Table~\ref{tab:mean_3gauss_fit}. The errors
are evaluated as the standard deviation of the best-fitting\LEt{Is there a difference between bes-fit and best-fitting? If not, could we go for consistency?    } parameter
values of the 18 \bm\ scans of {\tt BM18}.
These values are given to gain insight into the beam profile, but they are not
used for the calibration procedure. We find the level of the first error
beam with respect to the total beam at about $-11\,\rm{dB}$ and
$-13\,\rm{dB}$ at 1 and $2\,\rm{mm}$, respectively.}

\subsection{Main beam}
\label{se:mainbeam}

The angular resolution of NIKA2 {\lp is characterised using the FWHM of a
Gaussian fitted to the main beam. This principal Gaussian encloses
most of the measured flux density of a point-like source.} 

\subsubsection{Main-beam characterisation methods}
\label{se:mainbeam_methods}
To characterise the main beam and to derive an estimate of its FWHM, we
have developed three methods. The first two methods, named
{\tt Prof-3G} and {\tt Prof-1G}, rely on a fit of the beam profile to
benefit from the signal-to-noise ratio increase after azimuthally
averaging the signal. The last one by contrast,
consists of an elliptical Gaussian fit of the beam map for a better
2D modelling, and is labelled {\tt Map-1G}. They are presented in more
detail below. \\

\noindent {\tt The Prof-3G} method consists of fitting the beam profile using the
three-Gaussian function defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:3gauss}. The main-beam
FWHM estimate is given by the best-fitting value of the FWHM for the
first Gaussian function. {\lp This main-beam FWHM estimate is expected
  to be immune to the first error beams
and side lobes, which are well accounted for. For consistency checks,
we also rely on two other methods that use simpler beam models.}\\

\noindent {\tt The Prof-1G} method relies on fitting a single Gaussian to the beam
profile after masking the portion of the profile where the
contributions of the side lobes and error beams are the
largest. Specifically, the side lobe mask is designed to cut out {\lp the
radius ranging from an inner radius
$r_{\rm{in}} = 0.65\, \mathrm{FWHM}_0,$ where FWHM$_0$ is the
reference Gaussian beam FWHM (see Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system})
to an outer radius $r_{\rm{out}} = 80''$,} centred on the beam
maximum.
The profile is estimated up to a radius of
$180''$, which is in the inner part of the beam map where the noise
variance is uniform.\\

\noindent {\tt The Map-1G} method consists of modelling the 2D distribution of
the main beam using a 2D elliptical Gaussian of size $\sigma_x$ and
$\sigma_y$. We characterise the NIKA2 main beam using
\begin{equation}
  FWHM = 2 \sqrt{2\ln {2}\, \sigma_x\sigma_y}.
  \label{eq:fwhm_geom}
\end{equation}
As with {\tt Prof-1G}, we use masked versions of the
beam map to avoid side-lobe and error-beam contaminations. 
While $r_{\rm{out}}$ is conservatively set to be $100''$,
$r_{\rm{in}}$ is left free to vary around a central value of about $8''$
for A1 and A3, and of about $12''$ for A2 to provide the best 2D Gaussian
fit.

\subsubsection{Data sets for the main-beam determination}
\label{se:mainbeam_dataset}

We select a sub-set of the chosen \bm\ scans described in
Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam} by discarding scans of Mars. {\lp Indeed, \bms\
towards Mars unveil the complex full-beam pattern, which extends beyond
radii of $100''$, so that the annulus side-lobe mask used in {\tt
Prof-1G} and {\tt Map-1G} is not sufficient to mitigate the error
beams and side-lobe effects.}
The 12 remaining \bm\ scans are analysed using the data reduction
pipeline of Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc} and projected onto maps
with a resolution of $1''$ and an angular size of $10'$. This data set
is referred to as {\tt BM12}.

We also consider series of shorter integration scans. We select
$5' \times 8'$ raster scans of moderately bright to very bright point
sources by thresholding the flux-density estimates at $1~\rm{Jy}$ at both
wavelengths.
After the baseline scan selection, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}, the data set comprises 154 %163
scans towards the giant planets Uranus and Neptune, the secondary calibrator
MWC349 and the quasars 3C84, 3C273, 3C345, and 3C454 (also known as
2251+158). For these short scans, which are referred to as {\tt
R154}, the data are reduced and projected onto $2''$
resolution maps. 

{\lp Finally, we use a series of 75 observation scans of Uranus and
Neptune, which includes both \bm\ and $5' \times 8'$ raster scans. 
This data set, which is referred to as {\tt UN75}, consists of all the
scans of Uranus and Neptune acquired during the \emph{reference}
observation campaigns (N2R9, N2R12, and N2R14).}


\subsubsection{Results}
\label{se:mainbeam_results}

We have derived the main-beam FWHM for the three arrays, the
$1\,\rm{-mm}$ array combination using the three methods presented in
Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_methods}, and the data
sets of Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_dataset}.
Namely, our main-beam FWHM estimates
consist of i) the median FWHM estimate using {\tt Prof-3G} on the
{\tt BM12} dataset, ii) the average FWHM estimate using {\tt Prof-1G}
on the {\tt UN75} data set, and the {\tt Map-1G} average FWHM using
either {\tt BM12} or {\tt R154}. 
By comparing these results, we test the stability of the FWHM
estimates against the choices of the data set and of the estimation
method. 

In the case of Uranus, the FWHM estimates are further corrected for
the {\lp average beam broadening induced by the extension of the
apparent disc of the planet, which is $0.19''$ and $0.12''$ at 1 and
$2\,\rm{mm}$, respectively.}
%At the IRAM $30\,\rm{m}$ latitude,
{\lp During the observation period, Uranus' disc diameter has varied
from $3.3''$ to $3.7''$. This diameter variation translates into beam
broadening variations of an amplitude of a few tenths of arcseconds,
which are neglected.}  

The results of this analysis are
gathered in Table~\ref{tab:fwhm}, including uncertainties evaluated as
the rms dispersion of single-scan-based FWHM estimates.
{\tt Prof-1G} and {\tt Map-1G} results are in agreement within
uncertainties, whereas {\tt Prof-3G} yields slightly smaller FWHM.
{\lp The latter is more robust against the error beams and large radii
beam features than the formers, as was expected.}
Combined results are obtained from an error-weighted
average of the four FWHM estimates for each array.
Because the rms errors estimated using the 12 \bm\ scans may be
optimistic considering the small statistic, they are conservatively
increased to match the uncertainty estimates based on the {\tt R154}
data set before performing the weighted average.  
The combined results, as given in
Table~\ref{tab:fwhm}, provide a robust evaluation of the
FWHM. Thus, we report main-beam FWHMs of $11.1'' \pm 0.2''$ at
$1\, \rm{mm,}$ and $17.6''\pm 0.1''$ at $2\, \rm{mm}$.

The main-beam FWHM estimates using data of the three campaigns are in
agreement within rms errors. Moreover, the main-beam FWHM is stable
against atmospheric conditions at both wavelengths. Slightly lower than average values (about $11''$) are observed in the best
atmospheric conditions at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ providing us with a lower limit
in the absence of correlated atmospheric noise residuals. We note
three scans acquired during the N2R12 campaign with larger FWHM than average at
$2\,\rm{mm,}$ although the atmospheric transmission was excellent: this
is likely an effect of atmospheric instabilities%the anomalous refraction
, which affected a large number of observation scans during N2R12.

\subsection{Main-beam efficiency}
\label{se:beam_efficiency}

We derive the main-beam efficiency for each array, which is defined as the
ratio of the solid angle sustained by the main beam to the total beam
solid angle.
{\rev To estimate the total beam solid angle, we primarily use the maps
of the beam pattern presented in Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam}, which
provide us with an accurate representation of the main beam and of the
first error beams. However, at angular scales larger than the radius
of the noise de-correlation mask, 90'', the
filtering effect induced by the data processing becomes
non-negligible (see also Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}). Furthermore,
heterodyne observations at the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope
towards the lunar edge, and estimates of the forward beam efficiency using
skydips, show that a significant fraction of the full beam stems
from angular scales much larger than $90''$~\citep{Greve1998,
Kramer2013}. Thus, the accurate assessment of the total beam solid
angle requires us to account for the filtering effect and the large
angular-scale contributions. To that aim, we resort to a hybrid
approach. We utilise both the full-beam pattern measurements with
NIKA2 as presented in Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam}, and the results of the
IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope beam pattern characterisation using EMIR
front-end observations~\citep{Carter2012}, as reported
in \citet{Kramer2013}. These results gave two different outcomes.}

{\rev Firstly, the main beam and error beams are measured using
observations towards the limbs of the Moon. As EMIR detectors were coupled to
the \trentemetre\ telescope entrance pupil via corrugated horns, the
contribution of the first error beam is significantly attenuated
compared to the NIKA2 case. In fact, the first error beam measured by
NIKA2 is not detected with EMIR, while the second error beam is
measured with both NIKA2 and EMIR at compatible levels. The third and
fourth error beams, which originate from the IRAM \trentemetre\
telescope frame misalignment and panel deformations, respectively, are
expected to be measured by EMIR without
attenuation~\citep{Kramer2013}. We assume these latter are
characteristics of the \trentemetre\ telescope without any significant
dependencies on the receiver instrument.}

{\rev \LEt{Could we join this to the previous paragraph? Seems a strange moment to start a new one.}Secondly, the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope forward efficiencies
$F_{\rm{eff}}$ are derived using skydip scans with EMIR. Their
measurements allow us to estimate the far side-lobe efficiencies,
which receive two different contributions. The \emph{forward}
spillover and scattering efficiencies are estimated as $F_{\rm{eff}}$
subtracted from the main-beam and error-beam efficiencies, and
the \emph{rearward} spillover and scattering efficiencies equal
$1-F_{\rm{eff}}$~\citep{Kramer2013}.}

{\rev To sum up, we estimate the solid angle of the total beam as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \Omega_{\rm{tot}}(\nu) =& \int_0^{2\pi} \left( \tilde{B}_{\nu}(r)
  + \mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{(3)} G_{\nu}^{(3)}(r) + \mathcal{A}_{\nu}^{(4)}
  G_{\nu}^{(4)}(r) \right)  2 \pi r dr  \\
  &+ \,  \Omega_{\rm{FSL}}
  (\nu),
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:omega_tot}

The main-beam efficiency estimates using the three methods are gathered
in Table~\ref{tab:beam_efficiency}: central values and error
bars are evaluated as the median and the rms error of the
estimates on individual observation scans, respectively. 
{\rev We combined the results of the three methods, which are in
agreement with each other, using an inverse variance-weighted
average and a quadratic mean of the rms uncertainties. 
The main-beam efficiency uncertainties, as given in
Table~\ref{tab:beam_efficiency}, also include uncertainties on the
third and fourth error-beam contributions and on the \trentemetre\
telescope forward efficiencies, as reported
in \citet{Greve1998, Kramer2013}.}
Using the combined results, we report main-beam efficiencies of
{\rev $47 \pm 3 \%$ at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ and  $64 \pm 3 \%$ at $2\,\rm{mm}$.}

\section{Atmospheric opacity}
\label{se:opacity}
%\input{Opacity.tex}

The atmospheric opacity constitutes the ultimate limitation of
ground-based experiments. Only a fraction of the source 
signal is transmitted by the atmosphere and reaches NIKA2 detectors. 
The relation between the observed flux density
$\tilde{S}_{\nu}$ and the top-of-the-atmosphere flux density $S_{\nu}$
is parametrised by the zenith opacity $\taunu$
and the \airmass\ $x$ as %$x = \left(\sin\elev\right)^{-1}$, such as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{S}_{\nu} = S_{\nu} \, e^{-\taunu  x}.
\label{eq:uncorr_flux}
\end{equation}

An accurate derivation of the atmospheric opacity for each scan is
of utmost importance to retrieving the source signal and thus to
ensuring small calibration uncertainties.
We developed three atmospheric opacity derivation methods, which are described in
Sect.~\ref{se:opacity_methods}. In Sect.~\ref{se:opacity_tests}, we
present robustness tests.

\subsection{Atmospheric opacity estimation}
\label{se:opacity_methods}

We developed three procedures for the atmospheric opacity
derivation: i) {\tt taumeter} relies on measurements
provided by the resident IRAM \taumeter\ operated at $225\,\rm{GHz}$;
ii) {\tt skydip} consists of using NIKA2 as a total-power \taumeter\ 
by resorting to a series of {\tt skydip} scans;
iii) {\tt corrected skydip} is a modified
version of the {\tt skydip} method that minimises the dependence of the
estimated flux density on the opacity.
None of the methods i) rely on an ATM model nor on any
hypothesis on the atmospheric contents for the sake of robustness or
ii) use the laboratory measurements of the bandpass (see 
Sect.~\ref{se:instru_bandpass}) for more accuracy.  

Section~\ref{se:taumeter-method} presents the {\tt taumeter} method. The 
{\tt skydip} method is described in Sect~\ref{se:skydip-method}, and
the selection of the used {\tt skydip} scans is discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:skydip-selection}.
{\tt Finally, corrected skydip} is presented in Sect.~\ref{se:corrected-skydip}.

\subsubsection{The {\tt taumeter} method}
\label{se:taumeter-method}

The IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope facility is equipped with a
resident \taumeter\ operated at 225\,GHz. Every four
minutes, it performs elevation scans at fixed azimuth
to monitor the atmospheric opacity.
The IRAM science support
team provides us with time-stamped zenith opacities at $225\,\rm{GHz}$
$\tau_{225}$, as derived from the \taumeter\ measurements. The
$\tau_{225}$ estimates come in two different flavours:\LEt{Are you sure this is the term you'd like to use? I corrected it previously, but perhaps, seeing as it is repeated, I'm  missing something?} one relying
on a linear model, and the other on an exponential fitting model. They
are then filtered by removing outliers and by using a threshold on
goodness-of-fit criteria.
Based on IRAM experience, we use the linear fit and filtered $\tau_{225}$
data for the NIKA2 analysis. The time-stamped $\tau_{225}$ estimates,
which are sampled about every four minutes, are interpolated to the time
of the NIKA2 scans (we consider the time of the middle of the
scan). To cross-check, we also produce a smooth version of time-stamped
$\tau_{225}$ data by
filtering with a running median of seven samples, which is then
interpolated to the NIKA2 scan times.

We fit the relations between the IRAM
$225\,\rm{GHz}$ \taumeter\ opacities and NIKA2 band pass opacities using
observation of calibration sources which spans a large range of air
masses. This method has the advantages of not relying on an atmospheric
model nor on the bandpass measurements in the laboratory.
We use a series of 64 scans of MWC349, which consists of the
\baseline\ selected sub-set of scans from the 68 available scans for
this source during N2R9.
It constitutes a homogeneous data set in flux density, but
heterogeneous in atmospheric conditions: zenith opacities at
$225\,\rm{GHz}$ range from 0.08 to 0.32, and elevations from $23$ to $73$
degrees, spanning a large range of \airmass\ as required.
NIKA2 opacities $\taunu$, for $\nu$ corresponding to the observing
frequency of Arrays 1, 2, 3, and the combination of Arrays 1 and 3, are estimated
from the $225\,\rm{GHz}$ \taumeter\ median-filtered linear-based opacity
estimates $\tau_{225}$ as
\begin{equation}  
  \tau_\nu =  a_\nu^{225}\tau_{225} + b_\nu^{225}.
  \label{eq:taumeter_model}
\end{equation}
The parameters $a_\nu^{225}$ and $b_\nu^{225}$ are fitted
to the data set so that the source flux density 
\begin{equation}  
  S_\nu = \tilde{S}_\nu\,\, e^{(a_\nu^{225}\tau_{225} + b_\nu^{225}) \, x}, 
  \label{eq:opacorr_taumeter}
\end{equation}
is constant within scans.

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}    
\end{table}

We tested two estimators of the flux stability. The first one relies
on minimising the standard deviation of the measured-to-median flux
densities ratio after atmospheric opacity correction using
Eq.~\ref{eq:opacorr_taumeter}. The second one is obtained by minimising
\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \, \left( \frac{S_\nu}{\rm{Med}(S_\nu)} -1 \right)^2,  
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the rms uncertainty of the flux density estimates. Note
that these estimators do not depend on
the absolute scale of the flux density of the source. Both estimators
yield consistent results that are combined and gathered in
Table.~\ref{tab:tau225-to-taunika}. The quoted errors
$\Delta a_\nu^{225}$ and $\Delta b_\nu^{225}$ are 1-$\sigma$ errors of
the fit.

{\rev We note that the atmospheric opacity correction using {\tt
taumeter} opacities yields stable flux density measurements with
respect to the atmospheric transmission by construction, as we
verify in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}. This means that the best-fitting
parameters of the model in Eq.~\ref{eq:taumeter_model} also correct
for any line-of-sight opacity-dependent systematic effects on the flux
densities, as are further discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:corrected-skydip} and Sect.~\ref{se:opacity_tests}.}

Because the IRAM \taumeter\ observes at a fixed azimuth, the
{\tt taumeter} opacities are not the line-of-sight opacities
for the observation scans. This is checked in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}, and it induces larger rms errors of
the top-of-the-atmosphere flux density estimates compared to
opacity correction methods that rely on NIKA2 skydip-based
measurements. The {\tt taumeter} method can thus be used
as an alternative method in case of failure of the NIKA2 skydip-based
methods, and to perform consistency checks.


\subsubsection{NIKA2 skydip-based method}
\label{se:skydip-method}

The NIKA2 {\tt skydip} method for the opacity derivation consists of
using the NIKA2 instrument as an in-band total-power \taumeter. {\lp The opacity
integrated in the NIKA2 bandpasses and in the line-of-sight of the
observing scan is thereby directly obtained.} 
This idea,
which was successfully tested with NIKA~\citep{Catalano2014}, relies
on the fact that the resonance frequency of each KID varies linearly
with the total power, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:tuning}.
Firstly, we have to calibrate the relationship between total
power and opacity. Then, we can use this calibration to measure the
opacity during a given scan. 

Firstly, we detail the opacity calibration. For each KID $k$, the
absolute value of its resonance frequency $f_{\rm{reso}}^k$ varies with the
atmospheric load according to
%
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm{reso}}^k  = c_0^k - c_1^k T_{\rm{atm}}[1-e^{-\taunu x}],
\label{eq:skydip}
\end{equation}
%
where $c_0^k$ is a constant equal to the KID resonance frequency at zero
opacity, $c_1^k$ is a calibration conversion factor in Hz$/$K, and
$T_{\rm{atm}}$ is the temperature of the atmosphere. %, $\taunu$ the zenith
%opacity and $\elev$ the observing elevation.
By assuming a homogeneous plane-parallel atmosphere, the
\airmass\ $x$ is defined from the elevation as
$x = \left(\sin\elev\right)^{-1}$. {\lp The Earth sphericity can be safely
neglected at the elevations in question here.}
We take $T_{\rm{atm}}$ as a constant equal to 270\,K. However, the opacity is
expected to slightly depend on the atmospheric temperature. For
example, in poor weather conditions (6\,mm of water vapour contents),
the zenith opacity in {\lp both observing bands} can vary by
about 10\% for temperature variations of 10\,K. The
effect of the temperature variations on the final
calibration of NIKA2 response to the sky load is mitigated by using
several dedicated observation scans regularly distributed all along an
observation campaign.

%%%%%%%FIG8
The $c_0^k$ and $c_1^k$ are determined using {\tt skydip} scans, which
consist of moving the telescope in elevation step by step, as
defined in Sect.~\ref{se:skydip}. For each KID $k$, the evolution
of $f_{\rm{reso}}^k$ is monitored as a function of the \airmass\ in each
elevation step to perform a joint fit of the zenith opacity $\taunu$ and
the $c_0^k$ and $c_1^k$ coefficients.
All skydips, obtained under various opacity conditions, are analysed
together to break the degeneracy between the opacity and the
Hertz-to-Kelvin conversion factor $c_1^k$. The degeneracy occurs mostly for low-opacity
conditions for which we can only determine the combination
$c_1^k \taunu x$. The procedure has two steps. Firstly, all the {\tt
skydip} scans are analysed individually to extract $f_{\rm{reso}}^k$ for each
stable elevation and for each KID. Secondly, a simultaneous fit is done
for all parameters (one $\taunu$ per skydip, and a set of $c_0^k$ and
$c_1^k$ for all KIDs). Figure~\ref{fig:skydipfitexample} illustrates the
fitting procedure.
%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption[]{Example of global skydip fit for a KID.
Each square point represents one step in a skydip (made of eleven
elevation steps). A series of 12 {\tt skydip} scans are jointly used,
spanning zenith opacities from 0.15 to 0.50 {\lp in the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ band}. The horizontal axis gives the sky
effective temperature $T_{\rm{sky}} = T_{\rm{atm}}[1-e^{-\taunu\, x}]$ in Kelvins, where $\taunu$ is the
skydip zenith opacity found in the fit. The vertical axis shows the relative
resonance frequency of the KID with respect to 1.9\,GHz, given in MHz. The blue line is the linear
model using the best-fit $c_0^k$ and $c_1^k$ coefficients (see
Eq.~\ref{eq:skydip}).}
\label{fig:skydipfitexample}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
{\lp This fit is performed on a block of 40 KIDs. We check that the
resulting $\taunu$ from the different blocks are consistent within rms
errors, which are equal to about $4\times 10^{-3}$ at 1\,mm, and
$1\times 10^{-3}$ at 2\,mm.}
Once the $\taunu$ values are estimated for each {\tt skydip} (as the average over the
blocks), we compute, while fixing the $\taunu$, the $c_0^k$ and $c_1^k$
final values for each KID $k$ with a linear fit. We thus retrieve
the coefficients of all the KIDs ,even though some of them could not
contribute to the $\taunu$ determination. 

{\lp We have observed that the  $c_0^k$ and $c_1^k$ coefficients vary
between observational campaigns due to a change in the KID properties
from one cool-down to another.}
However, by comparing the results of different skydips, we verified that the
coefficients $c_0^k$ and $c_1^k$ are stable, within the fitting errors, over very
long time scales within a cool-down cycle. The coefficients can thus be
applied to the whole observing campaign for the opacity derivation. % in order to recover the
% opacity of each scan.
Specifically, the opacity %for each array
%$A_i$, $i=\{1, 2, 3\}$
is retrieved for each observation scan by
inverting Eq.~\ref{eq:skydip} as\begin{equation}
\taunu =   \rm{Med}\left( -\frac{1}{x} \log\left( \frac{f_{\rm{reso}}^k - c_0^k}{c_1^kT_{\rm{atm}}} +1 \right)\right), 
\end{equation}
where the median is evaluated using all the valid
KIDs of the concerned arrays. Therefore, we are able to derive an opacity
integrated in the NIKA2 bandpasses and in the line of sight of the
source in the considered observation scan.

\subsubsection{{\tt Skydip} scan selection}
\label{se:skydip-selection}

The {\tt skydip} opacity derivation requires a
sizeable amount of {\tt skydip} scans --
typically ten to twenty -- that i) span the whole opacity range, and
ii) avoid highly perturbed atmosphere to meet the plane-parallel
atmosphere assumption. To that aim, we performed\LEt{?? - reminder to review tenses} a {\tt skydip}
scan twice a day during a scientific campaign. Then, the ($c_0^k$, $c_1^k$)
determination process relies on a selection of the {\tt skydip} scans.

For each {\tt skydip} scan and %for each block of 40 KIDs,
for each KID, 
we compute the difference between the measured KID resonance frequency and the model
given in Eq.~\ref{eq:skydip} taken at the best-fit values of the
($c_0^k$, $c_1^k$) parameters{\lp, which is named $df_{\rm{reso}}^k$.} Then, we
determine two indicators of the fit quality per {\tt skydip}. {\lp Firstly,
for each block of 40 KIDs, the standard deviation of $df_{\rm{reso}}^k$ is calculated
over all the KIDs of the block. This standard deviation per KID block
is called $\sigma_{40}$. For each {\tt skydip}, we evaluate the
median rms, which is the median $\sigma_{40}$ over all the KID blocks.}

This fit quality indicator is also sensitive to the noise
level during the {\tt skydip}. We therefore devise a second fit quality
indicator to further measure the bias between the data and the
best-fit model.
Namely, for each {\tt skydip}, we compute the average
$df_{\rm{reso}}^k$ of each KID $k$ and convert this quantity from Hertz to Kelvin
using the corresponding $c_1^k$ parameter. This cross-calibration
allows us to compare the $df_{\rm{reso}}^k$ estimates from different KIDs.
Median $dT$ is the median of the average $df_{\rm{reso}}^k$ in Kelvin over all the KIDs of an
array. With these two indicators in hand, we discard the {\tt skydip} scans
that are noisy or that yield a poor fit by applying the following selection
criteria:
\LEt{Again, I don't think this necessarily requires bullet points}
\begin{itemize}
\item Median $\rm{rms} < 1.5 \times 10^{4}~\rm{Hz}$
\item Median $dT < 1.6~\rm{K}$
\end{itemize}

The threshold values have been determined using the set of 44 {\tt skydip}
scans of N2R9. The Median rms cut corresponds to twice the median of
this quantity per {\tt skydip} scan, whereas the Median $dT$ cut is twice
the standard deviation of Median $dT$ over the {\tt skydip} scans.
The N2R9 {\tt skydip} scan selection is illustrated in
{\lp Fig.~\ref{fig:skydipselection},
which shows the complementarity between the two fit-quality
criteria. After selection, 15 skydips are kept for the final step of
the ($c_0^k$, $c_1^k$) fit in the case of the N2R9 campaign.}

The ($c_0^k$, $c_1^k$) estimation proceeds in two steps: firstly, the
parameters are estimated using all the available {\tt skydip} scans for a
given campaign, and then the estimation is repeated using only
{\tt skydip} scans that met the fit-quality criteria. After the second
iteration, we check that no extra {\tt skydip} scan outliers are left, as shown by
the 'v2' label data points in Fig.~\ref{fig:skydipselection}.

%
The stability of the ($c_0^k$, $c_1^k$) parameters, and hence the
{\tt skydip} opacity estimates, have been tested against the
choice of the selection criteria. We found that the $\taunu$
estimates are robust against the {\tt skydip} scan selection as long as the
selection includes good {\tt skydip} scans in high opacity condition
$(\tau_{1\rm{mm}} > 0.44),$ and as the poor
fitting {\tt skydip} scans, which mostly correspond to deviation from the
atmosphere plane-parallel model in high opacity {\tt skydip} scans (as seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:skydipselection}), are excluded.

\subsubsection{{\tt Corrected skydip}}
\label{se:corrected-skydip}
The opacity estimates are ultimately tested by assessing the
stability of the top-of-the-atmosphere flux densities of bright sources for a large
range of atmospheric conditions, as is addressed in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}. After opacity correction using the
{\tt skydip} $\taunu$ estimate, the calibration flux density
measurements show a residual dependency on the atmospheric
transmission, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}. This has
motivated the development of a corrected version of the {\tt skydip}
method that ensures the robustness of the flux densities against
atmospheric conditions.

{\lp As already noted in Sect.~\ref{se:skydip-method}, for small values of the
line-of-sight opacity $\taunu x$, only the parameter combination
$c_1^k T_{\rm{atm}}\taunu$ is constrained in
Eq.~\ref{eq:skydip}. Degeneracies between $c_1^k$ parameters, the
atmospheric temperature, and $\taunu$ can translate into a
scaling factor in the fitted skydip opacities
$\taunu^{\rm{skydip}}$. To take this effect into account, }  
we use the flux stability estimators described in
Sect.~\ref{se:taumeter-method} to fit a correction to $\taunu^{\rm{skydip}}$ such as
\begin{equation}  
  \taunu =  a_\nu^{\rm{skydip}}\taunu^{\rm{skydip}}.
  \label{eq:corrected_skydip}
\end{equation}

We find $a_\nu^{\rm{skydip}}$ of
$1.36 \pm 0.04$,
$1.23 \pm 0.02$,
$1.27 \pm 0.03,$ and
$1.03 \pm 0.03$ for A1, A3, A1$\&$A3, and A2, respectively.
Moreover, we test for an additional offset in the
correcting relation of the {\tt skydip} opacities given in
Eq.~\ref{eq:corrected_skydip}. We find best-fitting correcting factors
in agreement with the best-fit values estimated using the single-parameter
correcting relation, whereas the best-fit offsets are compatible with
zero at both wavelengths. We conclude that correcting the {\tt skydip}
opacity estimates for a normalisation as given in
Eq.~\ref{eq:corrected_skydip} is sufficient to ensure flux density
robustness against atmospheric opacity conditions.

The exact physical origin for the discrepancy of the empirical factor
$a_\nu^{\rm{skydip}}$ from the expected unity value {\lp for the
$1\,\rm{-mm}$ wavebands} is currently under investigation.
{\rev Besides the $c_1^k$-to-$\taunu$ degeneracy and the effect
of the variation of the atmospheric temperature, other explanations
include effects that are not directly related to the atmospheric
opacity derivation, as the empirical factor is measured on the flux
densities.} 
However, the stability of the flux densities corrected using the
{\tt corrected skydip} opacities {\lp and the consistency of the results using
several observation campaigns}, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}, constitutes a validation of this approach.


\subsection{Opacity estimate consistency checks}
\label{se:opacity_tests}

Firstly, we test the stability of the {\tt skydip} opacities from one
observation campaign to
another. The a) panels in Fig.~\ref{fig:skydip-to-taumeter-correl} show the
correlation between the {\tt skydip} $\taunu$ estimates $\taunu^{\rm{skydip}}$
and the median-filtered time-stamped IRAM $225\,\rm{GHz}$ \taumeter\ 
zenith opacities $\tau_{225}$, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:taumeter-method}, for a series of scans
of Uranus and MWC349 acquired during the \emph{reference} observation
campaigns. As guidelines,
we also show the predicted correlations using an ATM model integrated
in the NIKA2 bandpasses and in the $225\,\rm{GHz}$ band. {\lp The
$\taunu^{\rm{skydip}}$ to $\tau_{225}$ correlation relations are
consistent within statistical errors for the three campaigns.}
At 1\,mm, they are also in agreement with the ATM model expectations,
while at 2\,mm, the ATM model underestimates the measured {\tt skydip}
$\taunu$. {\rev Possible explanations include a ground pick-up effect,
which would have comparatively more impact on the opacity derivation
at 2\,mm, where the atmosphere is more transparent, than at
1\,mm. A fraction of the beam indeed detects radiation from the
ground, as evidenced by forward efficiency measurements using
heterodyne front ends (see Sect.~\ref{se:beam_efficiency}).}
This mild discrepancy with the ATM model predictions is yet to be
understood, but has no impact on
our opacity measurements, which do not rely on this model nor on
the precision with which the observing bandpasses are known. {\lp
Further consistency test with ATM expectations will be performed in the
future using \emph{in-situ} bandpass measurements with a
dedicated Martin-Pupplett spectrometer.}


We further check the robustness of $\taunu^{\rm{skydip}}$ against the
observing elevation. 
Panel b) in Fig.~\ref{fig:skydip-to-taumeter-correl} shows the ratio of NIKA2
{\tt skydip} opacities to the $225\,\rm{GHz}$ \taumeter\ opacities as a function of
the average scan elevation. The {\tt skydip} opacity measurements have
no significant dependency on the elevation. Moreover, we observe that
the results are consistent for Uranus \bm\ scans and for
the shorter raster scans of the secondary calibrator MWC39, indicating
that the {\tt skydip} opacity estimates do not depend on the type of
observation scans.


As a summary, NIKA2 {\tt skydip} opacity estimates i) have reproducible
correlation coefficients with the $225\,\rm{GHz}$ \taumeter\ opacities from one
campaign to another, ii) are robust against the observing conditions,
and iii) are stable for various sources and scanning strategies. {\lp
In addition to these properties, the {\tt corrected skydip} opacities
further ensure flux density measurements that are immune to the
atmospheric and observing elevation conditions. We use them in
the \emph{baseline} calibration.}

\section{Calibration}
\label{se:calibration}
%\input{Calibration_1.tex}

In this section, we present the absolute calibration of the flux densities. We
use Uranus as the main primary calibrator. Section~\ref{se:calibration_method}
describes the absolute calibration method, Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field} presents
the inter-calibration of all the KIDs and the flat fields. While
gathering several observations of calibrators, we evidenced a
daily variation of the absolute calibration
coefficients related to daily variation of the beam
size induced by weather temperature. If left uncorrected, it leads to
a sizeable increase of the calibration uncertainties. To
overcome this issue, we primarily flag the most impacted observation
times of the day and exclude them from further analysis.
We discuss this effect in
Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}. In Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration},
the \emph{baseline} calibration procedure is summarised, and stability
tests are performed.

\subsection{Absolute calibration procedure and photometric system}
\label{se:calibration_method}

Here, we detail the procedure for calibrating the absolute scale of
the flux density and the chosen photometric system.

\subsubsection{Photometric system}
\label{se:photometric_system}

The main primary calibrators of NIKA2 are the giant planets Uranus and
Neptune. The latter is used when the former is not visible in the most
stable observing conditions. The flux density expectations of the
primary calibrators are derived in Appendix~\ref{ap:ref_flux_calibrator}. 
%
\begin{table}[!htbp]
\caption{NIKA2 reference frequencies and FWHM}
\label{tab:definitions}
\centering     
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline\hline
      \noalign{\smallskip}
      & 1 mm & 2 mm \\

      \noalign{\smallskip}
      \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We parametrise the primary calibrator flux density as 
$S_{\rm{c}}(\nu) = S_{\rm{c}}(\nu_0)\, f(\nu/\nu_{0})$, where $f(\nu/\nu_{0})$
encloses the spectral dependence, 
as a function of a reference frequency $\nu_{0}$ that we choose
arbitrarily to be: $\nu_{0} = 150$~GHz for the $2\,\rm{-mm}$ array, and
$\nu_{0}= 260$~GHz for both $1\,\rm{-mm}$ arrays. After projecting the raw
data (in units of the KID resonance frequency shift, $\rm Hz$) of a
calibrator {\sl c} on the sky, we model the calibrator raw map as a
fixed-width 2D Gaussian
\begin{equation}
  R_{\rm{c}}(\theta, \phi)  = A_{\rm{c}} \, e^{-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2\sigma_{0}^{2}}},
  \label{eq:gaussian_amplitude}
\end{equation}
{\lp where $A_{\rm{c}}$ is the amplitude of the 
Gaussian in Hz,} and $\sigma_{0}$ is derived from the
reference FWHM, labelled FWHM$_{0}$, which is $12.5''$ for the $1\, \rm{-mm}$
arrays and $18.5''$ for the $2\,\rm{-mm}$ array. These values have
been chosen larger than the main-beam values, as reported in
Sect.~\ref{se:beam}, to account for a fraction of the signal stemming from
the first error beam and first side lobes.
Both the reference frequency, $\nu_0$, and the reference FWHM, FWHM$_{0}$, define
our reference photometric system, as summarised in Table~\ref{tab:definitions}.

The absolute calibration coefficients are estimated from observations
of primary calibrators $c$, as the ratio of
the calibrator flux density expectations at the reference frequency
$S_{\rm{c}}(\nu_0)$ and $A_{\rm{c}}$. Then, for any observed point-like source
{\sl s} of projected map $R_{\rm{s}}(\theta,\phi)$ in Hz, the map
\begin{equation}
  M_{\rm{s}}(\theta, \phi) = \frac{S_{\rm{c}} (\nu_{0})}{A_{\rm{c}}}
  R_{\rm{s}}(\theta,\phi)
  \label{eq:pointsourcephot}
\end{equation}
is calibrated in Jy/beam. {\lp The best-fit amplitude estimate
of the fixed-width FWHM$_{0}$ Gaussian on this map directly gives an
estimate of the flux density of the source at the reference
frequency $S(\nu_{0})$, excluding colour corrections.}

\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Colour correction}

The flux density estimate $S(\nu_{0})$ gives the
flux of the source at the reference frequency only if the source has
the same spectral behaviour as the calibrator. In general, to retrieve the
flux of the source at the reference frequency, a colour correction
$C_{\rm{s}}$ has to be applied:
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm{s}}(\nu_{0}) = S(\nu_{0}) \,  C_{\rm{s}}(\nu_{0}, I_\nu^{\rm{s}}),
\end{equation}
which depends on the reference frequency $\nu_{0}$, the source
SED $I_\nu^{\rm{s}}$ , and the NIKA2 bandpasses.
Neglecting the effect of the atmosphere on the NIKA2 transmission, we
compute the colour-correction factor for target sources of SED that are
different from Uranus using
\begin{equation}
  C_{\rm{s}}(\nu_{0}, I_\nu^{\rm{s}}) = \frac{\int_{0}^{+\infty} I_\nu^{\rm{c}}~T({\nu})\, d\nu}{ \int_{0}^{+\infty} I_\nu^{\rm{s}}~ T({\nu})\, d\nu},
    \label{eq:color_correction}
\end{equation}
where $T({\nu})$ is the NIKA2 transmission
(Sect.~\ref{se:instru_bandpass}).
Assuming Rayleigh-Jeans SED for the calibrator
($I_\nu^{\rm{c}} \propto (\nu/\nu_0)^{\alpha_{\rm{c}}}$), the source
($I_\nu^{\rm{s}} \propto (\nu/\nu_0)^{\alpha_{\rm{s}}}$), and a
spectral index $\alpha_{\rm{c}} = 1.6$ for Uranus, we provide colour-correction factors for eight values of the spectral index of the
source $\alpha_{\rm{s}}$ in Table~\ref{tab:mod}.


\subsubsection{Extended sources}
\label{se:extended_source_calib}

{\rev While study-of-point sources are usually performed with maps given in
Jy/beam unit, diffuse emission studies or aperture photometry ones
require map expressed in Jy/sr. To that aim, we need to take into
account the full-beam pattern, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_efficiency}.}
Firstly, we correct, with the solid angle enclosed in the
reference fixed-width Gaussian beam, $\Omega_{0} = 2\pi \sigma_0^2,$ to
obtain a map homogeneous with Jy/sr. Then, to account for the signal in
the total beam pattern, we further correct with the reference beam
efficiency BE$_{0}$. As it is defined as the ratio of $\Omega_{0}$ and the
total beam solid angle $\Omega_{\rm{tot}}$, BE$_{0}$ represents the
fraction of the full-beam solid angle that is enclosed in the solid
angle sustained by the reference beam. To summarise, the map in Jy/sr
$M(\theta, \phi)$ relates to the map in Jy/beam
$M_{\rm{s}}(\theta, \phi)$ using
%
\begin{equation}
M(\theta, \phi) = \frac{\rm{BE}_{0}}{\Omega_{0}} \, M_{\rm{s}}(\theta, \phi).

estimates of the reference beam efficiency, which are derived from the
measured $\Omega_{\rm{tot}}$ as given in
Sect.~\ref{se:beam_efficiency}.}

\subsubsection{Calibration procedure}
\label{se:practical_calib}

{\lp In practice, the calibration procedure is performed in two steps. Firstly,
$S_{\rm{c}}(\nu_{0})$-to-$A_{\rm{c}}$ ratios per detector $G_k$
are estimated for each KID $k$ using the map per KID projected from
a \bm\ scan of a calibrator. The calibration coefficient $G_k$
for the KID $k$ is computed at zero atmospheric opacity as:
\begin{equation}
  G_k = \frac{S_{\rm{c}}(\nu_0)\, e^{-\taunu\,x}}{A_k},
  \label{eq:kid_gain}
\end{equation}
where $S_{\rm{c}}(\nu_0)$ is the expected flux density of the source at
the reference frequency $\nu_0$ (see
Appendix~\ref{se:ref_flux_uranus_neptune}), $\taunu\, x$ is the
line-of-sight opacity measured using the {\tt corrected skydip} method
(see Sect.~\ref{se:opacity}), and $A_k$ is the best-fit
amplitude of the reference FWHM$_0$ Gaussian, which is fitted in the
KID map. % using Eq.~\ref{eq:gaussian_amplitude}.
This first step accounts for both the relative calibration between KIDs and the absolute
calibration using a single calibrator scan.

Secondly, the absolute calibration is further refined by evaluating a
flux density rescaling factor using a series of observations of
Uranus or Neptune. After the first step of the calibration is
performed, the KID TOI is projected into a calibrated map $M_\nu$, as
described in Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}, where $\nu$ stands for the three
arrays and the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ array combination, and the atmospheric attenuation
is corrected. For each of the calibrator observation scans, we
compute the ratio between the expected calibrator flux density
$S_{\rm{c}}(\nu_{0})$ and the measured calibrator flux density in $M_\nu$, which
is estimated as described in Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}. The
flux density rescaling factor per array is the average
expected-to-measured flux-density ratio over all the selected calibrator scans.} 

The primary calibrator scans are first selected as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}. Then, in addition to
the \emph{baseline} scan selection cuts, we use a Gaussian beam size
criterion. The FWHM estimated from the planet
observation map is required to be lower than $12.5''$ at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ and lower
than $18''$ at $2\,\rm{mm}$. In further mitigating the flux scatter
due to beam broadening, we ensure better accuracy of the absolute
calibration.

\subsection{Relative calibration \& flat fields}
\label{se:flat_field}
While absolute calibration of each KID also \emph{de facto\LEt{Reminder to remove italics where necessary}} provides
relative calibration, the latter is interesting in itself to
characterise the instrument. We focus on this aspect in this
section.

\begin{figure*}[!thbp]

  1, 3, and 2, respectively. {\lp The offset positions with respect to the centre of

  system. The colour code gives the value of the KID calibration
  coefficients, as defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:kid_gain}, normalised by the
  average calibration coefficient over all the
  KIDs of the array.} The bottom plots

  using Array 1 KIDs that are positioned out of the shadow zone

 \label{fig:avg_mbff}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The dispersion of the detector responsiveness across the field of view (also known as\ flat
fields) has been characterised in the following ways:
\noindent \emph{Main-beam flat fields.} These represent the focal plane
distribution of the calibration coefficients per KID. {\lp They describe the
focal plane distribution of the point spread function (PSF) in
the far field of the telescope.} The calibration coefficients $G_k$ are
estimated using Eq.~\ref{eq:kid_gain}, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:practical_calib}.
\noindent \emph{Forward-beam flat fields.} These are the focal plane
distributions of the relative response of
each KID to the near field atmospheric background. They are estimated
using the correlation factor of each detector TOI 
to a median common mode estimated off-source (see Sect.~\ref{se:toi_proc} for
more details on common modes).

Figure~\ref{fig:avg_mbff} %and \ref{fig:avg_fbff}
shows the average main-beam %and forward beam
flat field for the three arrays. These were constructed by
combining the normalised flat fields of five \bms\ acquired during two
technical observation campaigns. These data were
selected by thresholding the line-of-sight opacity measured in the
1-mm band to $\taunu\,x \leq 0.85$. The distributions for the average flat
fields are shown in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:avg_mbff}.% and \ref{fig:avg_fbff}.

We observe a significant variation of the flat fields for A1 from the left-most side
to the right-most side of the FOV. This reveals a significant change of A1
detector responsiveness depending on their position in the focal plane. Namely, this
effect mainly impacts the left-most third of the array, which is
referred to as the 'shadow zone''. This variation of the
flat field translates into a broadening of the distribution shown in
the lower panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:avg_mbff}.  However,
we verified that A1's flat-field dispersions are in line with those of A3 after the
detectors within the shadow zone were flagged out using a
crescent-shaped mask. The masked flat-field distributions are shown in
green in Fig.~\ref{fig:avg_mbff}, %and \ref{fig:avg_fbff}
whereas shadow-zone distributions are in red. The same FOV patterning
is also observed in the forward beam flat fields, which excludes a
main-beam-related issue. 

The shadow-zone effect is caused by {\lp misbehaviour of the dichroic in
the polarised transmission which is out of specifications. As a
result, the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ polarisation that illuminates A1 is
attenuated.}
This effect,
which implies {\lp a dependence of the frequency cut-off on the radiation
incidence angle and linear polarisation,}
was reproduced using optical simulations. Furthermore, this hypothesis was
verified using observations at the technical campaign of September
2018. During this test campaign, a new \emph{hot-pressed} dichroic had
been installed in place of the current \emph{air-gap} dichroic.
The shadow-zone variations of the flat field for A1 were
not observed during the September 2018 campaign, while huge distortions
across the field of view of A2 were reported. These distortions result from the bending of the hot-pressed dichroic at low temperatures.
This test confirmed that the shadow-zone effect was due
to incoming radiation absorption by the current air-gap dichroic.
Further efforts are currently being conducted to the design of a dichroic that
combines robustness against bending induced by low temperatures, and
optimal transmission.
{\lp The air-gap dichroic, which is immune to low-temperature-induced
deformation, has been re-installed at the end of the September 2018
run coming back to the instrumental set-up discussed in this paper. We
found that, as expected, the performance of the instrument
after this intervention was consistent with the one reported in this
paper.}

%       TEMPERATURE-INDUCED VARIATION
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The temperature-induced variation effect}
\label{se:beam_variation}

We evidenced a daily variation of the flux density estimates that correlates to the
measured beam size. This beam broadening happens mostly in afternoons and around
sunrise and sunset. It is also reproducible from one campaign to another. It most certainly
comes from the combination of two different effects.

Firstly, inhomogeneous solar illumination leads to large-scale deformations of the
\trentemetre\ primary mirror, which in turn leads to variable de-focussing of the
telescope. {\lp To mitigate this effect, the telescope is equipped with an
  active thermal ventilation system of the primary mirror and an active
  temperature control of the secondary support legs. This system is, however,
  challenged when the Sun partially illuminates the telescope}
  %, like around
  %sunrise and sunset.}
  {\lp This is a known effect that also impacts
  observations with the heterodyne instruments operated at the IRAM
  \trentemetre\ telescope. It had also been already observed with the previous
  generation total-power instruments MAMBO-2 \citep{Kreysa1999}.} However, the
magnitude of this effect is likely to have increased with the slow disappearance
of the surface painting of the primary mirror in the past few years.
Secondly, on short time scales, atmospheric anomalous refraction {\lp also often plays a
  role.} As far as the \trentemetre\ telescope is concerned, it was first
described in~\citet{Altenhoff1987}. Based on experience with
  the heterodyne receivers, afternoon hours are
  often affected by an unstable atmosphere when rising moist air moves
  through the beam of the telescope and causes random refraction. The pointing
  is then observed to change within few seconds by few arcseconds\LEt{'within few seconds by few arcseconds' - not sure what you mean here. Please review for clarity} {\lp resulting in an average
    enlargement of the beam pattern.} This effect has been confirmed by
  measuring several arcsec displacements of the source position when projected using
  different subsets of sub-scans of a single observation, as described
  in Appendix~\ref{ap:beam_monitoring}. We find that the apparent beam broadening during
  the afternoon results from anomalous refraction for between one third
  and one half of the scans over the period studied here.
{\lp As both effects (the primary mirror deformations and the anomalous
  refraction) are due to ambient temperature variations, we refer to them as
  \emph{temperature-induced variation effects} in the following text.}\\

      and $2\,\rm{mm}$ (bottom panel) as a function of the

      planets (filled circles) and bright point-like sources with a

\label{fig:beam_monitoring_otf}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The temperature-induced variation of the beam size as a function of
the UT hours is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam_monitoring_otf} for the
three reference campaigns using bright sources. These are
selected by thresholding the flux density estimates above $1\,\rm{Jy}$
at both wavelengths. The beam size is estimated by fitting a 2D
elliptical Gaussian to the map {\lp and computing the geometrical FWHM
using Eq.~\ref{eq:fwhm_geom}.} For resolved planets such as Uranus, the
FWHM estimates are corrected for the beam broadening caused by the finite
extension of the apparent disc of the planet, as in
Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam}.
We observe the same evolution of
the FWHM for all campaigns. 
This goes from a plateau at a median value of $11.3''$ at $1\,\rm{mm,}$
and $17.5''$ at $2\,\rm{mm}$ during the night, to a smooth rise that
reaches a maximum of about $14''$ at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ and $18.5''$ at
$2\,\rm{mm}$ around 16:00 UT hours. The beam broadening becomes large
around 15:00 UT and returns to the plateau only around 22:00 UT.
To mitigate the impact of the temperature-induced variation,
observation scans acquired during this time interval must be
discarded. The UT ranges that are discarded
using the \emph{baseline} scan selection (see
Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}) are shown as cross-hatched areas in
Fig.~\ref{fig:beam_monitoring_otf}.
They consist of the afternoon
period between 15:00 and 22:00 UT, as well as the period from 9:00 UT to 10:00 UT while the Sun
rises. 
{\lp While the global trend of the beam variations is the
same for all campaigns, we observe some variability in the amplitude
of the effect over the campaigns. This supports the assumption of the
important role of the partial illumination of the primary mirror by
direct sun light in the temperature-induced effect. This in turn
induces a variability of the amplitude of the effect depending on the
angle between the telescope bore-sight % telescope optical axis
and the Sun all along the
observations.}

The same beam size variations in time are observed using scans of giant planets
(Uranus and Neptune) or other bright
sources (mainly quasars). However, planets have slightly larger FWHM
estimates than quasars, because of
the larger contribution of the error beams to the fitted 2D Gaussian,
as their fluxes are measured with a higher signal-to-noise ratio.

%       BASELINE CALIBRATION
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Baseline calibration}
\label{se:baseline_calibration}

To assess NIKA2 performance, we rely on a baseline calibration that
utilises the following steps: i) the calibration in FWHM$_0$ Gaussian
as detailed in Sect.~\ref{se:calibration_method} is implemented, ii)
the effect of the temperature-induced variation of the beam size is
mitigated using the \emph{baseline} scan selection described in
Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}, and iii) the
atmospheric attenuation is corrected using the {\tt corrected skydip}
opacity estimation described in Sect.~\ref{se:corrected-skydip}.

The \emph{baseline} calibration is validated below by checking the
stability of Uranus flux density estimates against the beam size
(Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_scans}) and against the
atmospheric transmission
(Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_atm}). The \emph{baseline}
calibration results are compared on alternative calibration methods
using other opacity correction (Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_opacity}).


\subsubsection{Flux stability against the beam size}
\label{se:baseline_calibration_scans}

We present the Uranus measured-to-predicted flux-density ratio as a
function of the 2D Gaussian FWHM estimates and colour-coded from the
observation times given in UT hours in
Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_all}. {\lp As expected from the
discussion in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}, the largest FWHMs are
measured on scans acquired in late afternoon, especially from 16:00 UT
to 21:00 UT.}  


\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption[Uranus flux density stability against FWHM]{ Uranus flux-density ratio vs beam-size-after-baseline calibration. The ratio
of Uranus measured flux-densities-to-expectations as a function of the
measured 2D Gaussian beam FWHM is shown for the $1$-mm array
combination (top panel) and for Array 2\LEt{Please be consistent in terms of capitalisation (ex: Array 2 not array 2). Please check this throughout } (bottom panel) after absolute calibration using the
\emph{baseline} method. These plots include all Uranus scans acquired during the 
N2R9, N2R12, and N2R14 campaigns and whose beam FWHMs are below the threshold indicated
by the vertical red lines (open circles), as well as the scans that
met the \emph{baseline} selection criteria (filled circles).}
\label{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_all}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The flux density estimates were calibrated beforehand, so that the flux-density ratios would be equal to unity in average by construction.
We observe no significant dependence of the selected scan flux ratios
(shown as filled circles in Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_all})
on the beam FWHM. {\lp This gives a first indication of the efficiency
  of the \emph{baseline} scan selection to mitigate the
temperature-induced beam variation effect. The flux stability against
the beam FWHM is further assessed in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.}


\subsubsection{Flux stability against the atmospheric transmission}
\label{se:baseline_calibration_atm}

We test the stability of Uranus flux densities calibrated using the
\emph{baseline} method against the atmospheric transmission. The latter
depends on the measured zenith opacity $\taunu$ and the scan
average \airmass\ x as $\exp{(-\taunu \, x)}$. In
the first row of Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_atmtrans}, Uranus' flux ratio
is shown as a function of the atmospheric
transmission for the $1$-mm array combination and Array 2 and for the
three \emph{reference} observation campaigns (N2R9, N2R12, $\&$ N2R14). We
observe no significant correlation of the flux ratio with the atmospheric
transmission, which gives a first
indication of the robustness of the flux density estimates against the
atmospheric conditions using the baseline calibration. This is
further tested using a larger number of scans towards other sources in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.

\subsubsection{Comparison with other opacity correction methods}
\label{se:baseline_calibration_opacity}

As a cross-check, we derived the absolute
calibration factors using the {\tt taumeter}
(Sect.~\ref{se:taumeter-method}) and the {\tt skydip}
(Sect.~\ref{se:skydip-method}) atmospheric-opacity
correction methods. We then compare Uranus'
flux density estimates after absolute calibration using the baseline
calibration and these two alternative corrections. Figure~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_atmtrans}
shows the Uranus measured-to-modelled
flux ratio as a function of the atmospheric transmission for A1$\&$A3
and for A2 after the {\tt taumeter} correction (second row) and
after the {\tt skydip} correction (third row). We observe more
dispersion for the {\tt taumeter}-based flux ratio, whereas the {\tt
skydip}-based ratio is very similar to the baseline ratio, except
for a slight decrease in flux at low atmospheric
transmission. Thus, the {\tt taumeter} and {\tt skydip} atmospheric-opacity correction methods can be used for
the absolute calibration in complement to {\tt corrected skydip}, for example, to
perform robustness tests as described in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.

%       9./ Photometry&Stability
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Photometry \& stability assessment}
\label{se:photometry}
%\input{Photometry.tex}

Photometric capabilities of NIKA2 after the calibration presented in
Sect.~\ref{se:calibration}, are assessed in this section. Firstly,
we use observations of secondary calibrators (planetary nebulae NGC7027, CRL2688, and
MWC349A) to test the consistency of the flux density estimates with
expectations. The flux density expectations
in NIKA2 bands for these calibrators are given in
Appendix~\ref{se:ref_flux_secondaries}. Then,
we verify the stability of the photometry with
respect to the atmospheric conditions using a large number of
observations towards a large variety of {\rev point-like}
sources. 

The quality criteria used to assess the photometric capabilities and
calibration results are defined in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_criteria}.
In Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_baseline}, these criteria are evaluated
for the baseline calibration, and in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_others},
we compare these results with other calibration method results before
summarising the main results in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_summary}. 


%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%       Criteria
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Calibration accuracy and uncertainty assessment}
\label{se:photometry_criteria}

We assess the photometric performance by evaluating two
quality criteria: firstly, the calibration bias checks the accuracy of
the absolute calibration, and then the {\rev point-source} rms
calibration uncertainties test the stability of the flux
densities. {\rev The stability of the full-beam pattern at large
angular scales, which impacts the stability of the diffuse emission
flux density, is not tested here}. {\lp Finally, we review the
systematic uncertainties on the flux density.}


\subsubsection{Calibration bias}
\label{se:def_calibration_bias}

We define the calibration bias
$b_{\nu}$, where $\nu$ stands for Array 1, 2, 3 and the
$1\,\rm{-mm}$ array combination as
the ratio between the measured flux density $\hat{S}_{\nu}$ using the
%fixed-width Gaussian beam
reference photometry
(Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}) and the flux density
expectations $S_{\rm{s}}(\nu_0)$ as given in
Appendix~\ref{se:ref_flux_secondaries}. From a series of
secondary calibrator scans, we evaluate the average calibration bias
$b_{\nu}$, which, by construction, should be equal to
unity within uncertainties.
Moreover, we check the stability of the calibration bias against
the observed opacities as a robustness test of the
opacity derivation method. Likewise, we verify that the photometry is
insensitive to optical variations by checking the stability of the
calibration bias against the measured beam size.

\subsubsection{{\rev Point-source} rms calibration uncertainties}
\label{se:def_calibration_rms_error}
We evaluate the standard deviation of a bright {\rev point-like} source
measured-to-median flux-density ratio $\sigma_{\nu}$ per array or array combination $\nu$.
As the flux density of most of the considered sources is a priori unknown, we
compare the flux density estimate in a single observation scan to the
average flux density throughout an observation campaign. This method
requires the selection of sources that are bright enough to be
detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio with a single repetition of an usual
$8'\times 5'$ OTF raster scan. Namely, we perform a source
selection process by setting a threshold on the flux estimate to $800\,\rm{mJy}$ at
$1\,\rm{mm,}$ and $400\,\rm{mJy}$ at $2\,\rm{mm}$. Moreover, we only consider the sources for which a minimum of $10$ scans are available after
selection to ensure a precise average flux density
estimation. Finally, the selected source scans must meet the \emph{baseline}
scan selection criteria given in Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}.

{\lp Since the flux-density ratios are not Gaussian-distributed, we
evaluate the 68 and 95\% confidence level (C.L.) contours using the
measured distributions in order to further characterise the
uncertainties. We check that the rms
errors are larger than the 68\% C.L. contours and thus provide
conservative $1\sigma$-like errors.}    

{\lp As the rms of the flux-density ratio is estimated on a scan set
that is representative of the observing conditions encountered at
the \trentemetre\ telescope, this is an estimate of the
calibration uncertainties that encloses errors of
optical, atmospheric, instrumental-noise, and data-processing
origins. This includes the errors sourced by the \afternoon\ beam 
variations, the effect of the elevation, the uncertainties of the
atmospheric opacity correction using either the {\tt skydip} or
the {\tt taumeter} method, and the atmospheric and instrumental noise
residuals after the data reduction (Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}). {\rev
However, as the data set comprises point-like sources, and because flux
density measurements in the reference photometric system are immune to
beam variations at large angular scales, we refer to the rms of the
flux-density ratios as point-source rms calibration uncertainties.}

{\rev For extended sources and diffuse emission studies, the maps in
Jy/beam units, where the beam refers to the reference beam, are
converted into Jy/sr units using
Eq.~\ref{eq:jybeam_to_jysr}. Propagating the uncertainty on the
total beam solid angles, the reference beam efficiencies are estimated
with a precision of 5$\%$ and 3$\%$ at 1 and 2\,mm,
respectively, as reported in Table~\ref{tab:reference_beam_efficiency}
in Sect.~\ref{se:extended_source_calib}. These uncertainties must be
further accounted for in the error budget of diffuse emission studies.}


\subsubsection{Absolute and systematic uncertainties}
\label{se:def_systematic_errors}

To account for all uncertainties, we must add the absolute calibration
uncertainties and the systematic errors to the {\rev
point-source} rms calibration uncertainties. The absolute uncertainty is
the uncertainty on the primary calibrator flux density expectations. 
In the case of Uranus, \citet{Morenothesis} and \citet{Bendo2013} report 
uncertainties of about $5\%$ at both wavelengths.

For the \emph{baseline} calibration method, which resorts to the {\tt
corrected skydip} method for the atmospheric opacity correction (see
Sect.~\ref{se:corrected-skydip}), the uncertainties on the
correcting factor $a_\nu^{\rm{skydip}}$, as defined in
Eq.~\ref{eq:corrected_skydip}, must be propagated to the flux
uncertainties. These uncertainties, which are referred to as the
{\tt corrected skydip} uncertainties, depend on the line-of-sight atmospheric
opacity $\taunu x$. Precisely, because the {\tt corrected skydip}
opacity correction is consistently used for both the primary
calibrator and the target source flux measurement, the {\tt corrected skydip}
uncertainties depend on the difference between the average
line-of-sight opacity of the primary calibrator scans and the
line-of-sight opacity of the source scan.   
We evaluate the {\tt corrected skydip} uncertainties for two
different $\taunu x$ values. 1) For the reference IRAM \trentemetre\
winter observing conditions, defined as $2\,\rm{mm}$ of pwv and an
elevation of $60^{\rm{o}}$, the {\tt corrected skydip} uncertainties are of
0.6\% at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and 0.3\% at $2\,\rm{mm}$. 2) In the worst
observing conditions allowed by the \emph{baseline} scan selection
(Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}),
which are $\taunu x$ of 0.7 at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and of 0.5 at
$2\,\rm{mm}$, we find {\tt corrected skydip} uncertainties of 2\% and
$1.5\%$ at 1 and $2\,\rm{mm}$, respectively. These constitute
conservative upper limits on the {\tt corrected skydip}
uncertainties.

The uncertainties on NIKA2 bandpass measurements (see
Sect.~\ref{se:instru_bandpass}) propagate into
uncertainties on the flux densities after the colour correction using
Eq.~\ref{eq:color_correction}. These
uncertainties depend on the source SED but are negligible in most of
the cases. In particular, for MWC349, we find uncertainties below 0.1\% at
both wavelengths.}

\subsection{Baseline calibration photometry results}
\label{se:photometry_baseline}

We measure the calibration bias and rms uncertainties, as defined
in the previous section (Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_criteria}) using the
\emph{baseline} calibration method (Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration}).
The calibration bias is evaluated using a
series of scans of MWC349 acquired during the
%N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14
 reference observation campaigns. Namely, we use the 72 scans that met
 the \emph{baseline} selection
 criteria (see Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}) over the 109 available
scans for MWC349. The first row of
Fig.~\ref{fig:mwc349_obstau_others}, labelled 'baseline', shows the
calibration bias $b_{\nu}$ for the combination of the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ arrays and
Array 2 as a function of the atmospheric transmission 
$\exp \left( - \taunu \, x \right)$. No significant dependency of the
calibration bias on the atmospheric transmission is observed.

Table~\ref{tab:baseline-photometry} gathers the calibration bias
estimates for the three observation campaigns and for all the scans.
In the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ band, we find
$b_\nu$ in agreement with unity within the statistical dispersion for
the three campaigns,
whereas a $5\%$ lack of flux with respect to expectations is observed
at $2\,\rm{mm}$, which is consistent for the three campaigns. This bias has low significance with respect to the absolute calibration precision of
NIKA2 (see Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_criteria}).
This is further investigated using other calibration methods
in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_others}.

measured-to-median flux densities evaluated from bright source scans
for the combination of Arrays $1\&3$ and Array 2 as a function of the
atmospheric transmission and is colour-coded as a function of the
observation time. From a total of 487 scans towards
flux-selected sources, acquired during N2R9, N2R12, and N2R14, 264 met
the baseline selection criteria and are included in
Fig.~\ref{fig:allbright_rms_corrected_skydip} to test the
calibration stability. The calibration uncertainties are
estimated using the standard deviation of the flux-density ratios for
the three campaigns. Results are gathered in
Table~\ref{tab:baseline-photometry}.
Combining all the scans, we find rms uncertainties of $5.5\%$ for A1,
$6.0\%$ for A3, $5.7\%$ for the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ band, and $3.0\%$ for A2.
%%%%%%% 95% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\lp Using the flux ratio distributions, we construct the 68 and 95\%
C.L. intervals. The 68\% C.L. intervals are $-6.4\%$ and $+3.4\%$ at
$1\,\rm{mm,}$ and $-3.8\%$ and $+1.5\%$ at $2\, \rm{mm}$. Therefore, on average,
the 68\% C. L. errors are of $4.9\%$ and $2.7\%$ at 1 and $2\, \rm{mm}$,
respectively. We conclude that the rms errors are conservative
estimates of the 68\% C. L. errors at both wavelengths. The 95\%
C.L. contours are $-15.8\%$ and $+5.9\%$ at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ and $-8.6\%$ and
$+3.8\%$ at $2\, \rm{mm}$.
The rms errors and the 95\%
C.L. interval are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:allbright_rms_corrected_skydip} with the inner and
outer dashed lines, respectively.} 

The flux-density ratio is constant within the rms errors along the
wide range of tested atmospheric transmission, ranging from 0.5 to 0.9
at $1\,\rm{mm}$.
However, some scans at atmospheric transmissions of about 0.7 at
$1\,\rm{mm}$ show a mild lack of flux density with respect to the
median within the 95\% C. L. contours. The scans
affected by the lack of flux have all been observed
either between 12:00 and 14:00 UT or between 8:00 and 9:00 UT are close to the threshold of the observation time cuts of
the \emph{baseline} scan selection (see
Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}). These scans are likely
to be affected by the \afternoon\ beam broadening or by the
sunrise focus drift, respectively. Furthermore, we find that restricting the
used observation time to the ten more stable hours (from 22:00 to
08:00 UT) would result in rms calibration uncertainties of
$3.6\%$ at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ and $1.2\%$ at $2\,\rm{mm}$, which constitutes an
improvement of about $60\%$ at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ and $40\%$ at $2\,\rm{mm}$
of the rms errors.  
The \emph{baseline} scan selection, which i)
retains 16 hours of observation time
per day, and ii) 
{\lp results in state-of-the-art rms calibration
uncertainties,} constitutes {\lp a useful trade-off representative of most
of the observations with NIKA2.}

In this section, the \emph{baseline} calibration results are compared to
results drawn either using other calibration methods obtained from different
opacity corrections ({\tt taumeter} and {\tt skydip} as
discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_opacity}), or
including a photometric correction ({\tt PC-demo} and {\tt PC-point},
as described in Appendix~\ref{se:photometric_correction}) to mitigate
the \afternoon\ variation effect (Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}).
To test robustness, we evaluate and compare the photometry quality criteria of
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_criteria} for the five calibration methods.


\subsubsection{Calibration bias}
\label{se:calibration_bias_all}

We present the calibration bias as a function of the atmospheric
transmission for the five calibration methods in
Fig.~\ref{fig:mwc349_obstau_others} and report the results in the row
labelled 'Bias' of Table~\ref{tab:Calibration_results_all}.
At $1\,\rm{mm}$, all methods lead to flux-density estimates in
agreement with expectations within the rms dispersion. However,
{\tt taumeter} flux ratios have more dispersion than
the \emph{baseline} flux ratios, whereas {\tt skydip} shows some
dependency on the atmospheric
transmission, with a 10 to $15\%$ excess of the flux density with
respect to expectations at high transmission. This residual
systematic effect has motivated the development of the {\tt corrected
  skydip} method, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:corrected-skydip}. These features, which are
already noticeable from Fig.~\ref{fig:mwc349_obstau_others}, are
confirmed and further discussed later using more observation scans. On
the other hand, the calibration methods based on photometric
correction (Appendix~\ref{se:photometric_correction}) yield an
unbiased photometry (calibration bias in agreement with unity
within the rms error) while allowing the use of $30\%$ more
scans. These results are encouraging for the exploitation of scans
acquired during the observing periods
impacted by the \afternoon\ beam variation effect
(Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}).

At $2\,\rm{mm}$, all methods result in a similar calibration bias
of $0.95,$ with an rms error of $0.05$ estimated on the MWC349 scans. 
This corresponds to a low-significance $5\%$ lack of flux density
towards MWC349.
To summarise, the calibration bias at $2\, \rm{mm}$ is stable against
i) a large range of atmospheric conditions, ii) the observation campaign, iii) the
opacity correction method, and iv) the method to treat the
temperature-induced beam variation effect.
This $5\%$ lack of flux density is thus probably due to
uncertainties in the flux density expectations for this source.
They come in two flavours.\LEt{If you did decide to change this where previously mentioned, please make it consistent.}
{\lp Firstly, the uncertainties regarding the flux expectation, as reported in
Appendix~\ref{se:ref_flux_secondaries}, consist of the propagation of
the errors on the fitted SED from the \emph{Plateau de Bure Interferometre}
(PdBI) and the \emph{Very Large Array} (VLA) observations. Systematic
uncertainties that may also impact the SED are not included.}  
Secondly, the NIKA2 flux density extrapolation from
interferometer data may not be straightforward for MWC349. {\lp In
particular, NIKA2 flux extrapolation ignores the contamination by
strong masers in the radio recombination lines~\citep{masingRRL},
while strong maser emission lines are masked in PdBI observations to
measure the continuum. In addition, the resulting continuum shows
indications of variability.}


\subsubsection{Calibration rms uncertainties}

The calibration rms uncertainties for the five methods evaluated using
flux-selected source scans are gathered in the sub-panel labelled 'Rms'
of Table~\ref{tab:Calibration_results_all}.
Compared to the \emph{baseline} method, the {\tt taumeter} method leads to 
rms errors increased by about $40$ and $30\%$ at 1 and
$2\,\rm{mm}$, respectively. The {\tt skydip} method shows lower
dispersion but a mild correlation with the atmospheric transmission, as
discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:calibration_bias_all}.

In addition, we checked the flux-density ratios for all of the
scans with an atmospheric transmission of about 0.7, which was
discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_baseline}, by comparing
calibration methods with or without photometric correction. The
flux-density ratios are low (within the 95\% C.L. interval) for the scans
observed within 12:00 and 15:00 UT in the first three methods, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:allbright_rms_corrected_skydip} for
the \emph{baseline} method. By contrast, they are within the 68\% C.L. interval
when using a photometric correction. This further validates the
hypothesis that the low flux
density of these scans is due to a \afternoon\ beam effect, as assumed in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_baseline}. This also constitutes an example
of the calibration improvement obtained by using a
photometric correction.

Moreover, results based on the {\tt PC-demo} method show that rms
calibration uncertainties as low as $3.8$ and $2.2\%$
at 1 and $2\,\rm{mm}$ are within the reach of NIKA2 {\lp without any
selection based on the observation time.}
%without rejecting any observations.
However, we recall this method relies on 
accurate beam estimates. Using {\tt PC-point}, which is the
practical case, still improves the calibration uncertainties
with regard to the \emph{baseline} results, but by a factor of about $20\%$ in both
bands. Furthermore, the differences between
the flux-density ratios from {\tt PC-demo} and {\tt PC-point}, which are
seen, for example, from the corresponding panels of
Fig.~\ref{fig:mwc349_obstau_others}, are likely
to be due to the photometric correction noise
when monitoring the beam from pointing scans (see
Appendix~\ref{ap:beam_monitoring}). We conclude that more
control on the beam monitoring is needed before routinely using a calibration
based on photometry correction. By contrast, the baseline method
combines good performance with robustness.


\subsection{Summary}
\label{se:photometry_summary}
Among the methods that rely on the UT hour-based
scan selection to mitigate the effect of beam size variations, the
\emph{baseline} method shows the best performance in terms of calibration
bias and uncertainties. The methods that rely on a photometric correction
show good calibration results, and thus represent a promising lead
to further improve the calibration uncertainties. However, their
robustness depends on the accuracy of the beam monitoring. {\lp The
proposed beam monitoring based on {\tt pointing} scans induces some
extra dispersion of the flux densities. A more accurate beam monitoring is
feasible but requires the use of dedicated observation scans.} 
From the \emph{baseline} method results discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry_baseline}, we found that the measured
flux density of MWC349 is in agreement with expectations within $5\%$
for both wavelengths. Moreover, the {\rev point-source} rms calibration
uncertainties are of $5.7\%$ at $1\,\rm{mm,}$ and of $3\%$ at $2\,\rm{mm}$
using a series of 264 scans of sources of flux density above
$1\, \rm{Jy}$.
These results demonstrate the excellent accuracy and stability of the
NIKA2 {\rev point-source} photometric capabilities.

\section{Sensitivity}
\label{se:sensitivity}
%\input{Sensitivity.tex}

In this section, we derive the on-sky sensitivity of the instrument using a
large number of observation scans, including deep integration on faint sources,
and we assess the stability of our results against the observing
conditions.
We evaluate the noise equivalent flux density, which is referred to as
NEFD hereinafter. To further represent the mapping capabilities, we also
derive the mapping speed.
We first discuss the definitions and the technical derivation of these quantities in
Sect.\ref{se:integration_time} from measurements. Then, we briefly present
several estimation methods that have been considered and the data sets  selected in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}. Results, together with robustness
tests, are reported in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_results}.


\subsection{NEFD and mapping speed definitions}
\label{se:integration_time}

The NEFD is the $1\,\sigma$ error on the flux
density of a point source in one second of integration time,
considered at zero atmospheric opacity.
At this stage, we consider a map of a point-like source located at its
centre and observed with zero atmospheric opacity. The estimation of
the flux density uncertainty $\sigma$ is described in Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}.
Here, we derive the integration time from actual observations. Indeed,
it is not simply the duration of a scan, it depends on the KID
distribution in the FOV and the scanning strategy.
The flux density map, which has a resolution of $\Delta r$, also comes
along with a hit map $H_{\rm{p}}$, which counts the number of
data samples per pixel (see Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}).
From this, we derive the integration time at the centre
of the map as
\begin{equation}
t_{\rm{centre}} = \frac{\langle H_{\rm{p}}\rangle_{\rm{center}}}{f_{\rm{sam}}}\,,
\end{equation}

where $f_{\rm{sam}}$ is the sampling frequency and $\langle
H_{\rm{p}}\rangle_{\rm{center}}$ is the average of the hit map taken in a disc
of the radius of one FWHM in order to be immune to shot noise statistics in individual map
pixels. Correcting this quantity from the density of detectors per map pixel at
the same time gives the on-source integration time per beam, in other
words, the time when the source is actually being observed, by at least one
detector:

\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm{beam}} = t_{\rm{centre}}\, \frac{g^2}{\Delta r^2}\,,
\label{eq:t_det}
\end{equation}

where $g$ is the centre-to-centre distance between adjacent KIDs in the FOV
(Sect.~\ref{se:grid_distortion}), and $t_{\rm{beam}}$ matches the total duration of
the scan if the scanning strategy is designed so that the source is always in
the FOV and if the FOV is full of valid KIDs. The NEFD is defined
using the previous quantities as 

\begin{equation}
  \rm{NEFD} = \sigma \sqrt{t_{\rm{beam}}}\, 
\label{eq:nefd_def}
\end{equation}

and is given in $\rm{mJy}\cdot s^{1/2}$.

The mapping speed, $M_{\rm{s}}$, is the sky area $\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}$ that
can be mapped at a noise level $\Delta_\sigma$ of $1\,\rm{mJy}$ in an
integration time $\Delta_t$ of one hour. Noting $d_{\rm{FOV}} =
6.5\,\rm{arcmin,}$ the FOV diameter, and $\eta$ the fraction of valid KIDs for an
observation (Sect.~\ref{se:fov_geometry}), the mapping speed is

\begin{equation}
M_{\rm{s}} = \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}}{\Delta_\sigma\Delta_t} = 
\eta \, \frac{\pi}{4} d_{\rm{FOV}}^2 \, \frac{1}{\rm{NEFD}^2}\, ,
\label{eq:mapping_speed}
\end{equation}

and has units of arcmin$^2 \cdot \rm{mJy}^{-2} \cdot \rm{h}^{-1}$. 
In real observation conditions, characterised with a given atmospheric
opacity $\taunu$ and a given \airmass\ $x$, correcting the flux
density for atmospheric attenuation using Eq.~\ref{eq:uncorr_flux}   
increases the NEFD to 
\begin{equation}
\rm{NEFD}_{\taunu,\, x} = \rm{NEFD}\, e^{\taunu x.}
\label{eq:nefd_tau_el}
\end{equation}

Using these definitions, the integration time required to reach a target flux density uncertainty $\sigma_{obs}$ over an observing area
$\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}$ for an airmass $x$ and for an atmospheric opacity $\taunu$ is
\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm{obs}} = \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}}{ M_{\rm{s}}} \, \left(\frac{e^{\taunu\, x}}{\sigma_{obs}}\right)^2.
\end{equation}

\subsection{NEFD estimation methods and scan selection}
\label{se:nefd_method}

We developed several methods for the NEFD estimation. Firstly,
we use deep integrations on faint sources. Secondly, we resort to joint
analysis of multiple scans without combining them.

\subsubsection{Deep integration method}
According to Eq.~\ref{eq:nefd_def} and Eq.~\ref{eq:nefd_tau_el}, if a
source were observed under stable atmospheric conditions, the flux
uncertainty would scale directly like
$t_{\rm{beam}}^{-1/2}$. Using long-time integration observation on a
source, this relation provides both a way to estimate the NEFD and to
check that the noise does integrate down as expected with the integration
time. To that aim, we produce a series of maps, as described in Sect.~\ref{se:map_projection},
using an inverse-variance co-addition of an increasing number of observation
scans, and perform a photometric analysis on each map according to
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}. However, in practice, in particular for
integrations of several hours, observing conditions do change.
Since all the scans are not acquired in the same conditions of
atmospheric opacity and observing elevation, {\rev they do not need
the same atmospheric opacity correction, nor do they have
the same level of atmospheric noise residuals after the noise
de-correlation, as described in Sect.~\ref{se:toi_proc}}, and hence,
they do not contribute as significantly to
the co-addition. In such a case, an effective integration time for the
co-addition of $n$ scans is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
t_{\rm{eff}}(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\, t_i\,  e^{-2\taunu^i\, x_i},
\label{eq:sigma_tau_w8}
\end{equation}
%
where $t_i$, $\taunu^i$ , and $x_i$ are the integration time, and the zenith
opacity and the \airmass\ of the $i$-th scan of the $n$-scans
co-addition.
Generalising Eq.~\ref{eq:nefd_def}, the flux density uncertainties on
the co-addition of $n$ scans is $\sigma(n) = \rm{NEFD}/\sqrt{t_{\rm{eff}}(n)}$.
An estimate of the
NEFD can therefore be obtained in fitting
$\sigma(n)$ as a function of the corresponding $t_{\rm{eff}}(n)$.

\subsubsection{Scatter method}
For any scan, we derive $\rm{NEFD}_{\taunu,\, x}$.
Using Eq.~\ref{eq:nefd_tau_el}, the joint analysis of a series of
scans acquired with various observing conditions provides an estimate
of the NEFD. The scan sample can gather different sources. 
The selection of the source target for the NEFD derivation is
primarily based on the flux density. Noise
characterisation may indeed be biased {\lp by the signal of a bright source
stemming from the most extended error beams and far side lobes.}
We therefore restrict the analysis to sources with estimated flux below 1\,Jy.

Firstly, we test the stability of the NEFD estimates using the two methods on the
same data set. With this goal, during the N2R9 run, we selected \hls, a
moderately faint source \citep{2012A&A...538L...4C}, expected to have
flux densities of 74.5\,mJy at $1\,\rm{mm,}$
and 15.7\,mJy at $2\, \rm{mm}$. %(M.~Bethermin, private
%communication).
It was observed for about nine hours in total over three nights using
$8 \times 5$~arcmin$^2$ OTF raster scans of various orientations.\\


The left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} shows the flux density
uncertainties as a function of the integration time. The effective
integration time is different between the 1-mm and 2-mm arrays,
because they have different KID spacings $g$ in the FOV and different
atmospheric opacities (see Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma_tau_w8}). Black lines show
the fit with the inverse of the square root of the integration time,
confirming that the noise integration is well-consistent with the expected
scaling law. The observed small variations around the theoretical fit
correspond to variations of line-of-sight opacity during the
integration. These variations are taken into account for evaluating the NEFD, as
discussed in the previous section. The right panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} shows the
$\rm{NEFD}_{\taunu,\, x}$ per scan, along with best-fit models using
Eq.~\ref{eq:nefd_tau_el}, from which the \rm{NEFD} estimates are derived. 
Results from these analyses, per array and for the
combined A1 and A3, are presented in Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

We systematically observe higher NEFD for A1 compared to A3, which is a mainly
due to the dichroic-induced 'shadow effect' that also impacts the flat fields,
as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field}.  The dichroic-induced effect, which
also impacts A3, explains part of the NEFD difference of performance between the $1\, \rm{-mm}$
and $2\, \rm{-mm}$ channels, together with the higher atmospheric noise and lower
telescope beam efficiency at $1\, \rm{mm}$ with respect to the $2\,\rm{mm}$
wavelength. Moreover, the NEFD evolution with sky noise is well-consistent with expectations for each array and each observing wavelength.

%  comparison entre datasets
As a second robustness test, we check the stability of the NEFD for
three observation campaigns. Figure~\ref{fig:nefdvsbackground_below_1Jy} shows the
measured NEFD using the scatter method (see Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}) for the
sub-Jansky sources acquired at the N2R9, N2R12, and N2R14
campaigns. The NEFD estimates for the
three campaigns are in agreement within uncertainties for the whole
range of line-of-sight opacities that have been tested.
The solid lines show the expected dependence with
exp${[\taunu\,x]}$ as given in Eq.~\ref{eq:nefd_tau_el}. %for a background-limited sensitivity model.
Since the measured NEFD$_{\tau,\, x}$ are not Gaussian-distributed, we
derive the NEFD as the median of the NEFD$_{\tau,\, x}$
per scans after correction of the atmospheric attenuation, which provides us
with a more robust estimate compared to a fit. The NEFD estimates
are given in Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

Combining the data set of N2R9, N2R12, and N2R14 campaigns, more than one
thousand observations scans of sub-Jy sources meet the baseline selection
criteria (see Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}), providing robust NEFD estimates
that are representative of the average NIKA2 performance. The rms
uncertainties are evaluated as the rms scatter of the individual
NEFD$_{\taunu,\, x}$ estimates after correction with
$e^{\taunu\,x}$. 
These values are then extrapolated using the IRAM
\trentemetre\ telescope reference Winter observing conditions: $2\,\rm{mm}$ of
 pwv and a $60$ -degree elevation. The NEFD
estimates, as well as the rms uncertainties, are gathered in
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_astro}.
From these estimates, we also derive the corresponding mapping speeds,
which are also given in Table~\ref{tab:nefd_astro}.
We report mapping speeds of $1388 \pm 174$ and
$111 \pm 11 \, \rm{arcmin}^2\cdot \rm{mJy}^{-2}\cdot \rm{h}^{-1}$ at 1
and 2\,mm, respectively.

{\lp We present NIKA2 performance at the IRAM
  \trentemetre\ telescope and evaluate it with a
  \baseline\ calibration method that goes from
  observations and raw data to measured flux densities.
  In the \baseline\ calibration photometric system, the flux
  densities of point-like sources are measured as the amplitude estimates
  of a fixed-width Gaussian of FWHM of $12.5''$ and $18.5''$ at the
$150$ and $260\,\rm{GHz}$ reference frequencies, respectively.

  This method relies on three main analysis choices. Firstly, the
  atmospheric and instrumental correlated noises are corrected using a
  simple and robust method based on the subtraction of a series of
  the average temporal signals of the most correlated detectors. The
  atmospheric opacity is estimated using an improved version of 
  the method proposed in \citet{Catalano2014} and used in
  \citet{Adam2018}, which is based on the use of
  NIKA2 as an in-band total-power taumeter. Finally, a scan selection
  based on the observation time is performed and retains 16 hours
  of observation a day in order to mitigate the effect beam size
  variations caused by anomalous refraction of the atmosphere and
  partial illumination of the \trentemetre\ telescope that mainly
  impact the afternoon observations. We also consider the pros
  and cons of alternative methods, which may in the future lead to even
  better calibration accuracy and stability.}

The performance of the NIKA2 camera was assessed using a large
number of observations of primary and secondary calibrators and faint
 sources that were acquired during three
observational campaigns over one year. The data set spans the whole
range of observing
elevation and atmospheric conditions encountered on-site.
The main characteristics that define NIKA2 performance are
summarised in Table~\ref{tab:nika2summary}. We highlight the main
points here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item %\emph{FOV reconstruction}:
  All designed KIDs detect the
  signal at least in some observation
  scans. We conservatively retain only the most stable KIDs, which are
  immune to the cross-talking effect and yield good signal-to-noise
  measurements. 
  We report valid KID fractions of $84\%$
  for the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ channel arrays and $90\%$ for Array 2. The other
  KIDs, which do not meet the validity criterion, are randomly
  distributed across the FOV, so that the whole $6.5\,\rm{arcmin}$ FOV is
  covered.
  \vspace{1mm}
\item %\emph{Beam Properties:}
  The main beam is well-described with a 2D
  Gaussian of FWHM of $11.1''$ for the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ channel arrays,
  and $17.6''$ for Array 2, with uncertainties of $0.2''$ for the
  combination of Arrays 1$\&$3, and of $0.1''$ for Array 2.
  {\rev Comparing the main-beam fit to the measured full beam, and 
    including large angular-scale contributions from IRAM
    \trentemetre\ telescope heterodyne measurements, we derived the
  main-beam efficiency.}
  We find main-beam
  efficiencies of {\rev $48 \pm 4 \%$} at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and {\rev $63 \pm 3 \%$} at
  $2\,\rm{mm}$.
  {\lp These results show that a significant fraction of the power is received
    outside the main beam. This underlying,
    extended, low-level beam pattern shows a complex structure of error 
    beams, rings, spokes, {\rev and far side lobes}.}
  Using individual maps per KID, \citet{Adam2018} reported an rms
  dispersion of the main-beam FWHM across the FOV of about $0.6''$ at
  both wavelengths. This is consistent with the measured curvature of
  the best focus surface across the FOV. 
  {\lp We also provide the reference beam efficiencies, which are the
    fixed-width Gaussian beam efficiencies that allow us to take into
    account the power stemming from outside the reference beam, {\rev
      as is needed to study the diffuse emission.}} 
  % calib
  \vspace{1mm}
\item %\emph{Calibration uncertainties:}
  We evaluated the rms calibration uncertainties using 264 
  scans of {\rev point-like} sources of which the flux density is above about
  one Jy. We find {\rev point-source} rms calibration
  uncertainties of about $6\%$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and about $3\%$ at
  $2\,\rm{mm}$, which represent state-of-the-art performance for a
  ground-based millimetre-wave instrument. {\rev The rms calibration
    uncertainties for the diffuse emission must further include the
    uncertainties surrounding the reference beam efficiencies, as given in
    Table~\ref{tab:nika2summary}}. The absolute
  calibration uncertainties are of $5\%,$ and the systematic
  calibration uncertainties evaluated at the IRAM
  \trentemetre\ reference winter observing conditions are
  below $1\%$ in both channels.
   \vspace{1mm}
  % noise&sensitivity
\item %\emph{Sensitivity:}
  The noise does integrate well as the square root of the integration time. We
  derived a robust estimate of the NEFD using more than a thousand scans
  encompassing a large range of observing conditions. We find NEFD at zero
  atmospheric opacity of $30 \pm 3\,\rm{mJy}\cdot s^{1/2}$ at $1\, \rm{mm,}$ and
  $9 \pm 1\,\rm{mJy}\cdot s^{1/2}$ at $2\, \rm{mm}$.
  The NEFD estimates demonstrate the high sensitivity of
  the KID arrays of NIKA2. 
  The instrumental sensitivity at $1\,\rm{mm}$
  is, however, currently mainly limited by the non-optimal transmission of
  the air-gap dichroic plate%component% mirror ? filter ? element ? 
  , mostly prominent in one polarisation component
  (A1), but affecting the other (A3) as well.
  In addition to the dichroic upgrade, further possible areas of
  improvements for the $1\,\rm{-mm}$ observation channel are: 1)
  improve the data processing, and in particular the noise
  de-correlation methods, 2) increase the bandwidth of the $1\,\rm{-mm}$
  arrays (subjected to the improvement of the dichroic) and 3)
  upgrade the surface of the telescope.
   \vspace{1mm}
\item  NIKA2 mapping capabilities are better represented by evaluating the
  mapping speed, which is defined as the sky area that is covered in one
  hour of observation with a noise level of $1\,\rm{mJy}$. We find
  mapping speeds at zero atmospheric opacity of $111$ and
  $1388\, \rm{arcmin}^2 \cdot \rm{mJy}^{-2} \cdot \rm{h}^{-1}$ at
  $1\, \rm{mm}$ and  $2\, \rm{mm}$, respectively. The mapping speed of NIKA2 is thus at
  least an order of magnitude better than the previous generation of IRAM
 \trentemetre\ telescope resident continuum cameras~\citep{Catalano2014, Staguhn2011_GISMO, Kreysa1999}.
  
\end{enumerate}


We conclude that NIKA2 has unique capabilities in fast dual-band
mapping at tens arcsecond\LEt{Please check this. Could we say a resolution of tens of arcseconds? } resolution. {\lp It is currently available to the
whole community and will operate at the IRAM \trentemetre\ telescope
for at least the next decade.}
NIKA2 performance meets the requirements
of addressing a large range of science topics in astrophysics and
cosmology.

  \section{Reference flux density of the calibrators}
  \label{ap:ref_flux_calibrator}
  %\input{calibrator_flux_model.tex}

\subsection{Uranus and Neptune}
\label{se:ref_flux_uranus_neptune}

For the flux densities of the giant planets, we use the ESA calibrator models\footnote{The models used for the calibration of the \emph{Herschel} satellite are documented here: \url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/calibrator-models}}.
These models provide the planet brightness temperature in the
Rayleigh-Jeans approximation as a function of the frequency. The
resulting flux density of the primary calibrator is therefore 
\begin{equation}
S_c(\nu_0) = \Omega \, \frac{2 \nu_0^{2} k T_{RJ}}{c^2,}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the solid angle of the planet on the sky, %Following
%\citet{Bendo2013} and correcting their equation 12
which can be calculated using
%
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \pi \frac{r_{e} r_{p-a}}{D^{2,}} 
\label{eq:omega}
\end{equation}
where $r_{e}$ is the equatorial radius of the planet and $r_{p-a}$ is
its apparent polar radius, and $D$ the distance to the
planet. $r_{p-a}$ can be computed from the sub-observer latitude $\phi$
({\it e.g.} the latitude of the 30-m telescope as seen from the planet in the
planet equatorial reference frame) and the polar radius of the
planet $r_{p}$ as
\begin{equation}
r_{p-a} = \sqrt{r_{p}^2 \cos^{2}\phi + r_{e}^2 \sin^{2} \phi.}
\end{equation}

The planets' ephemerides are obtained using the
Horizon system\footnote{An interface to the Horizon system is given at \url{https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi}} with the quantities
listed in Table~\ref{tab:planetphysparam}. The planet flux densities for a given date are computed using a dedicated
photometry tool\footnote{This software is written in Python and available at \url{https://github.com/haussel/photometry/blob/master/notebooks/planet_fluxes.ipynb}}. The model spectra are linearly interpolated in log space at the
reference frequencies of the NIKA2 bandpasses.

The Uranus and Neptune models are compared to 
observations of these planets with the \emph{Planck}
satellite~\citep{PLCK-LII}.

For Uranus, the model used in the comparison
is the ESA V2, and it is found to over-predict by $4\,\rm{K}$ (about 4\%) the
observed RJ temperature at 143\,GHz, to agree at 217\,GHz, and
to under-predict at 353\,GHz. For the NIKA2 calibration, we used the ESA
model V4, which predicted\LEt{A reminder to check \textit{present vs past} tenses. Please revert back if I'm mistaken here.} a flux respectively -3.3\%, 0.3\%, and 4.7\% higher in the
143, 217, and 353\,GHz bands, that correspond to a few percent accuracy
with respect to \emph{Planck} observations.

For Neptune, the same study compared Planck observation with the ESA V5
model, which is the same one used for NIKA2 calibration. For this
planet, temperatures are found to disagree at most by $5\, \rm{K}$, which is 4.1\%,
with the same trend with frequency as observed for Uranus.

In summary, this study confirms that Uranus ESA V4 and Neptune ESA V5
models are accurate to 5\% for predicting planet flux densities. This
result also agrees with the accuracy estimated from Herschel SPIRE
and PACS observations~\citep{Mueller2016, Swinyard2014}. 
Furthermore, the variations of Uranus and Neptune fluxes over the duration of a typical
NIKA2 run are taken into account, although they are negligible
compared to the model accuracy. On the other hand, we
found\footnote{This effect is illustrated in the Python notebook
  distributed with the software at \url{https://github.com/haussel/photometry/blob/master/notebooks/planet_fluxes.ipynb}} that not
taking into account the planet shape and orientation with respect to
the observer in the computations of its solid angle can lead to errors
between 1 and 2\%.


\subsection{Secondary calibrators}
\label{se:ref_flux_secondaries}


The secondary calibrator MWC349 is a stellar
binary system, including the young Be star MWC349A, surrounded by a
disc. Its radio continuum emission
originates in an ionised bipolar outflow~\citep{Tafoya2004}. MWC349A has
been monitored with the PdBI and VLA, and
shown to be %stable in time and
only slightly angularly resolved,
making it a point source for the \trentemetre\ telescope.
We computed the flux densities at the NIKA2 reference frequencies 150 and
260 GHz with $S_\nu = 1.16\pm0.01 \times
(\nu/100 \rm{GHz})^{0.60\pm0.01}$ provided by this
monitoring\footnote{See \emph{e.g.} the talk given by M.~Krips at the 10th 
IRAM Millimetre Interferometry School in Grenoble (France) in October

%\noindent {\bf FM: MWC349A or MWC349 ?}\\

The secondary calibrator CRL2688 is an asymptotic giant branch
star. Its radio continuum emission is mostly from circumstellar dust
and is somewhat extended~\citep{Knapp1994}.  Its flux densities at
$850\ \mu$m and $450 \ \mu$m have been stable at the 5\% level as
monitored by SCUBA2 in 2011-2012~\citep{Dempsey2013_SCUBA2}.
We extrapolated these flux densities to 150 and 260 GHz
using the power law $S_s(\nu_0) \propto \nu_0^{\alpha}$ with an index
$\alpha=2.44\pm0.18$ derived from the SCUBA2 measurements.

% cahier I p. 128 et 129.

The secondary calibrator NGC7027 is a young, dusty, carbon-rich
planetary nebula with an ionised core.  It is extended in the
continuum and molecular lines~\citep{Bieging1991}, and it is not a point
source for the \trentemetre\ telescope.  Its most recent flux densities are
reported at $1100\, \mu$m and $2000\, \mu$m in~\citet{Hoare1992}. It was reported to decrease by $\sim$ 0.145 percent/yr in the optically
thin part of its spectrum above $6\,\rm{GHz}$ from VLA
observations~\citep{Zijlstra2008, Hafez2008}. This makes
these flux densities uncertain by 3.6\% currently. Its SED from cm
wavelengths to optical was also presented in~\citet{Hafez2008}. {\lp
\citet{Perley2013} measured its flux density between 1 and $50\,
\rm{GHz}$. Moreover, flux density measurements at 90 GHz over 20 years
with the \trentemetre\ telescope are presented in \citet{Kramer2008}.}
The flux densities were extrapolated to 150 and 260 GHz, and the
modelled decrease since 1992 is included.

All these expected flux densities extrapolated from the literature are
summarised in Table~\ref{tab:flux_ref_sec}.

\end{table*}

Measured flux densities, however, are determined over the broad
bandwidth of each array and so must be colour-corrected to be compared
to the expected flux densities of Table~\ref{tab:flux_ref_sec}.  For
this purpose, we have derived colour corrections for sources with spectral
indices $\alpha$ comprised between -2 and +4 in Table~\ref{tab:mod}. %\ref{ap:color_correction_JFL}.
Evidently, this effect can be a few percent for MWC349, NGC7027, and CRL2688.

  \section{Reconstruction of the focal surfaces}
  \label{ap:focus_surfaces}
  %\input{Focus_surfaces.tex}

Owing to the NIKA2 $6.5~\rm{arcmin}$ FOV, the focus is expected to
slightly change across the FOV, defining curved focal surfaces at the
location of the three arrays. Therefore, beam patterns are expected to
show some scatter across the FOV accordingly to the focal
surfaces. Although all the detectors on a flat array cannot be
individually focalised, an optimal axial focus of the telescope can be
found to maximise the number of detectors at the best focus, and hence they
maximise the resolution of the NIKA2 maps.
This optimal focus setting is obtained by measuring the focus at the
centre of the arrays as described in Sect.~\ref{se:axial_focus} and applies
a focus shift of $-0.2\,\rm{mm}$, which is 
predicted using ZEMAX simulations and verified by measuring
the focus surfaces as described in the following.

\begin{figure*}[!thbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[trim={0, 9.5cm, 0, 9.5cm}, clip=true, width=\linewidth]{Figures/fov_focus_mv_5.png}
\caption[Focus surfaces]{Focus surface of A1, A3, and A2 arrays from left to
  right. In this example, the focus estimates rely on the maximisation of the flux
  density. On each plot, the x and y axis are the Nasmyth offsets
  with regard to the centre of the array in arcsec, while the colour-code represents
  the relative focus estimate with regard to the central focus, given in mm.}
\label{fig:focus-surfaces}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Method}

We estimate NIKA2 focal surfaces by means of a sequence of five \bms\ of bright
point-like sources, typically planets or bright quasars, for various
axial positions $z$ of the telescope sub-reflector around its nominal
position, which is the optimal axial focus $z_{\rm{opt}}$. 
The axial position is changed in steps of $0.6~\rm{mm}$ to probe a large
focus range for measuring even the extreme variation of the focus surfaces,
namely $z \in \{-1.2, -0.6, 0, 0.6, 1.2 \} + z_{\rm{opt}}$.  Each
\bm\ is analysed using the data reduction pipeline, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}, and $4''$-resolution individual maps per KID
are produced. 
Therefore, a series of
five maps at various focus positions is available for each detector, from which
the best focus is estimated as described in Sect.~\ref{se:axial_focus}. The
ensemble of the relative focus estimate per KIDs with respect to the best focus
at the centre of the array constitutes the focus surface. An accurate estimate
of the centre focus is obtained as the weighted average focus estimate of the
KIDs lying in a $30''$ radius around the geometrical centre of the array. This
average does not induce any sizeable bias thanks to the flatness of the focus
surface in the innermost regions. To test robustness, we consider three focus
estimates: the first two are the same as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:axial_focus} -- namely i) $\hat z_{\rm{fwhm}}$ the focus that
minimises the geometrical FWHM, and ii) $\hat z_{\rm{peak}}$ the focus that
maximises the amplitude of the best-fitting elliptical Gaussian, while iii) is $\hat z_{\rm{flux,}}$ the focus that maximises the flux
density in the reference photometric system
(Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}). The comparison between the two
estimators based on Gaussian-amplitude fitting ($\hat z_{\rm{peak}}$
and $\hat z_{\rm{flux}}$) tests the stability of the focus
results against the exact choice of the beam fitting function.

\subsection{Data set}

Nine defocused \bm\ sequences were acquired, including incomplete
sequences and sequences hindered by poor atmospheric conditions. To
check for systematic effect, a focus measurement is performed
immediately before and after the \bm\ sequence. Using these
measurements, the central focus drift between the starting time and the
end of the sequence is estimated. 
We select sequences that i) comprise at least four scans (four
z-focus steps), ii) have been observed with a zenith opacity at $225\,\rm{GHz}$ (as indicated by
the IRAM \taumeter) below 0.5, and iii) have a maximum central focus
drift of $0.5~\rm{mm}$. These criteria preserve five sequences from which focus
surfaces can be reconstructed, %. Namely, we consider the sequences
%$20170226s415\mbox{--}419$, $20170419s133\mbox{--}137$, $20170420s113\mbox{--}117$,
%$20170421s160\mbox{--}164$ and $20170424s123\mbox{--}127$, which consist of observations
%of the bright quasar 3C84 and Neptune.
corresponding to observations of the bright quasar 3C84 and Neptune.

\subsection{Results}
For each detector $k$ and for each \bm\ sequence $s$, we obtain, for
the array $\nu$, a focus measurement $z_\nu^{k, s} \pm \sigma_\nu^{k, s}$,
where $\sigma_\nu^{k, s}$ is the $1\mbox{--}\sigma$ error of the least-square
polynomial fit. The focus surface measurements per array are obtained
as weighted averages of the five \bm\ sequences as in the
following:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mv_focus_surf}
z_\nu^{(k)} = \left( \sigma_\nu^{(k)} \right)^2 \,  \sum_s \frac{z_\nu^{k,s}}{\left(\sigma_\nu^{k,s}\right)^2}\, \,  ,
\end{equation}
with uncertainties 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:error_mv_focus_surf}
\sigma_\nu^{(k)} = \left[ \sum_s \frac{1}{\left(\sigma_\nu^{k,s}\right)^2}\right]^{-1/2}\, .
\end{equation}


We present NIKA2 focus surfaces per array obtained, as in
Eq.~\ref{eq:mv_focus_surf}, for the method of flux density maximisation  
in Fig.~\ref{fig:focus-surfaces}.
We further check that the three flavours\LEt{Please change if you did so previously} of focus estimators provide
us with focus surfaces per array that are in good agreement with each
other. Furthermore, they have a non-axisymmetrical flattened bowl
shape, which is well-consistent with expectations from optical
simulations using ZEMAX, but with slightly higher curvature amplitude.
Namely, the median defocus (that is the relative focus with regard to the
central focus) across the detectors is about
$-0.1~\rm{mm}$ for the three arrays. Maximum defocus values of about
$-0.6~\rm{mm}$ are found for detectors corresponding to the outer top and
left regions of the FOV.

We estimate the uncertainty of the focus
surface measurements using the standard deviation between the three
estimators $z_\nu^{(k)}|_{\rm{fwhm}}$, $z_\nu^{(k)}|_{\rm{peak,}}$ and
$z_\nu^{(k)}|_{\rm{flux}}$. We found approximatively homogeneous
standard deviation across the FOV with median values of about
$0.03~\rm{mm}$. We also verified the stability of the focus surfaces by comparing
results from a series of \bm\ sequences acquired at various dates and
in various atmospheric conditions.

{\lp In addition, using optical simulation, we found that the
variations of beam aberrations are much smaller than the
diffraction pattern, resulting in a quasi-invariant beam for a
wide range of defocus up to about $0.3\, \rm{mm}$ around the optimal
focus. For larger defocus, however, the beam starts to deteriorate in
some regions of the image plane.}
{\lp Using the results from the measurements and the optical
simulation, we optimise the focus of all detectors by setting the
focus at the value estimated at the centre of the arrays shifted of
$-0.2\,\rm{mm}$.}

  \section{Photometric correction}
  \label{se:photometric_correction}
  %\input{photometric_correction.tex}
 

The \emph{baseline} calibration (Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration}) relies on
the \emph{baseline} scan selection, as defined in
Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}, to mitigate the impact of
the \afternoon\ variation effect, as evidenced in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}.
By contrast, in this section, we
address the issue of calibrating even during the observing periods
impacted by the \afternoon\ beam variation effect. We discuss an
alternative calibration method that
relies on a photometric correction depending on the beam size.
{\lp The key idea is to perform a joint monitoring of flux estimates
  using the fixed-width Gaussian amplitude and the beam size.}
The objective is both to cross-check the baseline calibration results
using more observation scans, and to anticipate future developments
that could be deployed if an accurate beam monitoring is performed.


\subsection{Photometric correction method}
\label{se:photometric_correction_method}

When the beam size broadens due to \afternoon\ beam effect, for example, the flux
density is smeared in a larger solid angle, and the flux density estimator, which
is based on the amplitude fit of a Gaussian beam of fixed FWHM (see
Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}) is biased towards low flux
densities.

Indeed, up to a normalisation factor, the flux density
estimator in the reference photometric system (Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}) applied to a map
$M(\theta,\phi)$ reads

\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}  = \int \int M(\theta, \phi)\, e^{-\frac{d(\theta,\phi)^{2}}{2\sigma_{0}^{2}}} \sin \theta d\theta d\phi\,,
  \label{eq:flux_density_estimator}
\end{equation}

where $d(\theta,\phi)$ is the angular distance and $\sigma_0$
corresponds to FWHM$_0$
%, which we recall,
%is $12.5''$ for the $1\,\rm{mm}$ arrays and $18.5''$ for
%the $2\,\rm{mm}$ array
, as defined in Table~\ref{tab:definitions}.

Modelling the map of a point-like source with a single Gaussian of
width $\sigma$ and of amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ as

\begin{equation}
  M(\theta, \phi) = \mathcal{A} e^{-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2\sigma^2}}\,,
  \label{eq:pointsource_map}
\end{equation}

leads to

\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}  = 2\pi \sigma^2 \mathcal{A} \,  \frac{\sigma_0^2}{(\sigma^2 + \sigma_0^2)}.
  \label{eq:gaussian_star}
\end{equation}
As the map is calibrated using the reference Gaussian beam
(Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}), the absolute calibration factor %,
%which is evaluating as
%$S_{c}(\nu_{0})/\hat{S}_{c}$,
has a beam dependency that compensates the
$\sigma_0^2/(\sigma^2 + \sigma_0^2)$ factor in Eq.~\ref{eq:gaussian_star}.

Assume that we observe the source under stable conditions and
denote with a $\star$, the associated amplitude $\mathcal{A}_\star$, beam width
$\sigma_\star$ and flux estimate $\hat{S}_\star$. Using aperture
photometry, the energy conservation ensures that one has
$2\pi\sigma^2 \, \mathcal{A} = 2\pi\sigma_\star^2 \, \mathcal{A_\star}$.

To retrieve the flux estimate $\hat{S}_\star$ from the flux density
estimate $\hat{S}$, as obtained for any observations, a
corrected flux density $\hat{S}_{\rm{pc}}$ can be obtained using 
\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}_{\rm{pc}} = f(\sigma) \, \hat{S},
\end{equation} 
where the photometric correction is 
\begin{equation}
  f(\sigma) = \frac{(\sigma^2 + \sigma_0^2)}{(\sigma_\star^2+\sigma_0^2)}, 
\end{equation} 
so that $f(\sigma) = 1$ if $\sigma=\sigma_\star$.

Fig.~\ref{fig:f_sigma} shows how $f(\sigma)$ varies with the actual beam width
and for two choices of $\sigma_\star$ depending on the flux of the observed source.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[clip=true, trim={0.9cm, 0.1cm, 0.5cm, 0.5cm}, width=0.4725\textwidth]{Figures/photometric_correction_function_1Jy.pdf}
    \caption[Photometric correction]{Magnitude of beam photometric
      correction $f(\sigma)$ as a function of the actual FWHM, at 1\,mm (blue)
      and 2\,mm (red). Thick lines correspond to a choice of $\sigma_\star$
      derived on a very bright source like Uranus. Thin lines are for sources of
      1\,Jy at 1 and 2\,mm.}
\label{fig:f_sigma}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The beam size in stable atmospheric conditions $\sigma_\star$ is
determined by fitting the 2D Gaussian beam on the series of scans of
source with varying flux densities that were used for the beam
characterisation in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam}. However, $\sigma_\star$
is not equivalent to the main beam's Gaussian size since the side lobes
and first error beams are not taken into account for this beam size
monitoring. The $\sigma_\star$ estimates are slightly
larger for bright sources due to the contribution of the first side
lobes and error beams, which are above the noise level, in the Gaussian fit.


\subsection{Monitoring of the temperature-induced beam size variation}
\label{ap:beam_monitoring}

The photometric correction thus relies on the measuring of the current beam size
$\sigma$. The induced uncertainties on the flux density measurements depend on
the precision of the beam size determination. Here we
consider two methods to monitor the beam size.

The temperature-induced beam size variation is primarily monitored
using 2D Gaussian fit on all the available bright source observations,
as presented in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}. 

For a finer sampling of the observation time, we also consider using
the pointing scans for beam monitoring. As discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:pointing}, the telescope pointing is
monitored on a hourly basis during an observation using {\tt pointing}
scans. As these scans consist of two sub-scans in azimuth and
an elevation of about 10 seconds of integration time each, they
can also be used to make a map of the pointing source. For each campaign,
we thus have hundreds of maps of mostly point-like bright
sources, which can also be used to monitor the beam size. 
%traitement pointing scans
For this purpose, {\tt pointing} scans are reduced 
and projected onto maps of $2''$ resolution using
the data analysis pipeline described in Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}.
Fitting an elliptical 2D Gaussian to this map, we compute the geometrical FWHM. %$_{\rm{geom}}$
{\tt Pointing} scans on {\lp slightly extended} sources, such as NGC7027,
are discarded from the analysis.

% anomalous refraction
For each {\tt pointing}, we also seek signs of atmospheric
anomalous refraction. There are
enough KIDs per observation band to make an independent map using only
one sub-scan, such as ten seconds of integration time.
For each of the four cross sub-scans, we thus estimate the position of the best
2D Gaussian that fits the map. We compute the deviation between each
sub-scan-derived position and the best-fit position using the entire
scan. An anomalous refraction event is detected when the difference is
above $2.5''$ for at least one subscan. We find that the \afternoon\
beam size variation effect is due to anomalous refraction for
between one third and one half of the scans, as reported in
Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}.

The pointing-based FWHM estimates constitute a time-sampling of the
beam size during the whole observation campaign. They can serve as
estimates of the beam size of any observation scan, in particular
towards sources too faint for a direct FWHM %$_{\rm{geom}}$
fit to be made on the map. However, we
expect less accuracy than when using standard OTF raster
scans of bright sources due to the shorter integration time and the
fact that only the innermost KIDs in the array see the source.
To mitigate the dispersion, the time-stamped
pointing-based FWHM
%$_{\rm{geom}}$
is filtered with a running median on a 70-minute
width time window. Then, the FWHM %$_{\rm{geom}}$
at the time of the considered scans is
interpolated from the median-filtered pointing-based FWHM.%$_{\rm{geom}}$.

estimates on the OTF-scan map, and on the other hand the interpolation from
the pointing-based FWHM %$_{\rm{geom}}$
monitoring. The two estimates show the same global variations as a
function of the UT hours. They are very much in agreement with each
other, although the pointing-based estimates have more dispersion and
a few outliers, as expected.


\subsection{The two case studies}

We perform two case studies that correspond to the two beam monitoring
methods discussed above.\\

\noindent \emph{Demonstration case} \LEt{Reminder to remove italics}This method, referred to as {\tt PC-demo} hereinafter, uses a
photometric correction based on the beam monitoring with bright source
scans. Both the 2D Gaussian FWHM fit and the FWHM$_0$ photometry are performed
on the map of the source. This method thus applies only to point-like sources
that are bright enough for an accurate fit of the beam on a single scan.

To capture only the beam size variations driven by the
observing conditions (primary mirror deformations, anomalous
refraction, elevation), a small correction $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}}$ has to be made to
the 2D Gaussian beam FWHM estimate for bright sources. The estimate of the
actual Gaussian size $\sigma$ is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\sigma} = \frac{(\rm{FWHM} - \delta_{\rm{FWHM}})}{2\sqrt{2 \ln{2}}}, 
\end{equation} 
where the offset $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}}$ is null for faint or moderately
bright point sources, and non-zero for bright sources.
As for $\sigma_\star$, the 2D Gaussian fit yields slightly broader
FWHM for bright sources (e.g. planets) to accommodate
for the side lobes and error beams that are measured with high signal to noise.
For Uranus, $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}}$ includes also the beam widening due
to Uranus' disc, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_results}.
We measure Uranus $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}}$
by comparing the average %$\sigma_{\rm{geom}}$
FWHM estimates using Uranus
and MWC349 scans, we found $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}} = 0.4''$ at
1\,mm, and $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}} = 0.25''$ at 2\,mm, which basically
distributes with half due to Uranus finite extension and the
other half stemming from the side lobes.\\

\noindent \emph{Practical case using pointing scans} This method,
named {\tt PC-point} hereinafter, performs a photometric correction based on the beam monitoring with
pointing scans. 
Unlike {\tt PC-demo}, this method is usable even for sources fainter than
about one Jy \nico{but relies on interpolations between beam width estimates on
  other scans}. For Uranus, this value is corrected for the diameter size, as it is in
Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_results}. No other FWHM offset correction is needed since
pointing scan maps have a low signal-to-noise ratio, which prevents the
geometrical FWHM from being significantly affected by the side lobes.


\subsection{Absolute calibration with a photometric correction}

We perform the absolute calibration by i) implementing the reference
method described in Sect.~\ref{se:practical_calib}, ii) correcting the
atmospheric attenuation using the {\tt corrected skydip} opacity
estimates, and iii) using the photometric correction of
Appendix~\ref{se:photometric_correction_method}.

    \caption[Uranus flux density stability against FWHM]{
      \small{Uranus flux-density ratio vs beam size for calibration
  with photometric correction. The ratio of 
      Uranus' measured flux densities to expectations as a function of the
      measured 2D Gaussian beam FWHM is shown for the $1$-mm array
      combination (left column) and for array 2 (right column) after absolute
      calibration using (\emph{first row}) the {\tt PC-demo} and (\emph{second
        row}) the {\tt PC-point} photometric corrections. These plots
      include all Uranus scans acquired during N2R9, N2R12, and N2R14
      campaigns and for which the beam FWHMs are below the threshold indicated
      by the vertical red lines, (open circles), as
      well as the scans that met the baseline scan selection criteria (filled
      circles). A total of 38 scans now pass the \emph{baseline} selection criteria vs only 26
      without photometric correction (see also Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_all}).}}

Using the photometric correction alleviates the need to
perform a scan selection based on the observation time. However,
the scans from which the absolute calibration is derived are selected
on the FWHM estimate using the same criteria as for the baseline
calibration, which are FWHM thresholds of $12.5''$ at $1\, \rm{mm,}$ and $18''$ at
$2\, \rm{mm}$. Thus, only the scans that are moderately affected by the beam
effect are included in the absolute calibration in order not to
include the photometric correction uncertainties twice in the error
budget (once for the absolute calibration and once for the photometry).

Figure~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_photocorr} presents the Uranus
measured-to-predicted flux-density ratio as a function of the beam FWHM
after the photometric correction with the {\tt PC-demo} and
{\tt PC-point} methods. The flux
density is stable against the beam FWHM within uncertainties for both
wavelengths.

We further quantify the
difference between all the calibration methods that have been tested
in evaluating i) the average absolute calibration factor
with respect to the baseline calibration factor and
ii) the rms dispersion of the measured-to-modelled flux ratios. These
quantities are gathered in Table~\ref{tab:Abs_calibration_results_all}
in the rows labelled 'Ratio' and 'RMS', respectively. 

We find that resorting to a photometric correction i) allows us to use $45\%$ more
scans for the absolute calibration, ii) has a negligible impact on
the absolute calibration factor and iii) yields a small reduction of
the flux-density ratio dispersion. For the absolute calibration, the
{\tt PC-point} method performs as well as the {\tt PC-demo} one.
Photometry capability and stability when using a photometric
correction are further tested in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.\\
