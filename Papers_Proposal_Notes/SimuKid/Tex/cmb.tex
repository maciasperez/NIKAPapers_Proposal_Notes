\section{Non linearity and impact on CMB polarization measurements}
\label{sec:cmb}

Detecting CMB polarization $B$ modes is one of the major challenges in modern
cosmology. However, due to the faintness of the expected signal, systematic
effects must be controlled to challenging low levels. The specific way KID
photometry is derived is as new as this technology and we here investigate if it
might lead to non linearty in the photometry reconstruction, and how this would
impact CMB polarization measurements.

\subsection{Parameterization}

We assume that KIDs are placed right after a perfect polarizer along the optical
path. At each time, they therefore measure a combination of the Stokes
parameters $I$, $Q$ and $U$. To first order, the non linearity of the KID
response can be described by a parameter $\epsilon$ such as:

\begin{eqnarray}
m &=& \phi + \epsilon\phi^2 \nonumber \\
&=& (I+Q\cos2\alpha+U\sin2\alpha) + \epsilon(I+Q\cos2\alpha+U\sin2\alpha)^2 \nonumber\\
 &\simeq & (I + \epsilon I^{2}) + (Q + 2\epsilon IQ) \cos(2\alpha) + (U + 2 \epsilon IU) \sin(2\alpha)
\label{eq:eq-NL}
\end{eqnarray}

The non-linearity coefficient depends on the detector response. In fact, it is a systematic effect of the instrument and as a consequence will always impact our measurements. This non-linearity can lead to leakage of the CMB and dust temperature signal into the polarization maps and consequently can induce spurious polarization signals which could prevent us from detecting $B$ mode polarization. \eps\ is constituted of several components such as \eps\ related to the CMB and dust. $T_{dust}$ has more effect on the leakage than $T_{CMB}$  that is why we will focus on dust.
To study this effect we simulate spurious signals from a map of the galaxy (dust) observed by Planck (REF) by applying the non-linear mapping described by Eq.~(\ref{eq:eq-NL}) :

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:spurious-mapI}
\Delta I_{dust}  &=& \epsilon I_{dust}^{2},\\
\label{eq:spurious-mapQ}
\Delta Q_{dust}  &=& 2\epsilon I_{dust}Q_{dust},\\
\label{eq:spurious-mapU}
\Delta U_{dust} &=& 2 \epsilon I_{dust}U_{dust}.
\end{eqnarray}

To investigate the different modes of CMB polarization we used the HEALPix package \citep{2005ApJ...622..759G} to generate modified power spectra from the spurious polarization maps. They are described by Eq.~(\ref{eq:eq-cl}) and are represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:cl2}.

\begin{equation}
\Delta C_{l} = \epsilon'^{2} C_{l}^{XX'},
\label{eq:eq-cl}
\end{equation}
Where $\lbrace X,X' \rbrace$ = $\lbrace T,E,B \rbrace$ .\\

	\label{fig:cl2}
\end{figure}

Here we will focus on the leading spurious term $C_{l}^{TE}$ : 
\begin{equation}
\Delta C_{l}^{BB} = \epsilon^{2} C_{l}^{TE}.
\label{eq:eq-cl2}
\end{equation}

The leakage of temperature into polarization is represented by the coefficient \eps\ of Eq.~(\ref{eq:eq-cl2}). To determine this coefficient, we compute :

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \sqrt{\dfrac{r/10}{C_{l}^{TE}}},
\label{eq:eq-cl3}
\end{equation}

they are represented in Tab. \ref{tab:eps-lkg}

\begin{table}[h!]

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  	\hline
 	\backslashbox{$\epsilon$}{$r$} & 0.1 & 0.01 & 0.001 \\
	\hline
	$\epsilon'$ & 7.90 x $10^{-4}$ & 2.50 x $10^{-4}$ & 7.90 x $10^{-5}$\\
  	\hline

\caption{Non-linear coefficients related to the leakage of temperature into polarization for scalar-to-tensor ratio r = (T/S) = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001.}
\label{tab:eps-lkg}
\end{table}

In the search of $B$ modes polarization, Planck anticipated a $r$ detection threshold of 0.1 . In Tab. \ref{tab:eps-lkg}, we calculated \eps\ for lower tensor-to-scalar ratio ($(T/S) = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001$). To be able to detect $B$ modes polarization at this level without being contaminated by the leakage of temperature into polarization, the non-linearity coefficient related to the detector and the signal reconstruction must be lower than \eps\ of Eq.~(\ref{eq:eq-cl2}). By satisfying this criteria we can satisfy the other \eps\ from Eq.~(\ref{eq:eq-NL}) because $C_{l}^{TE}$ from dust temperature is the leading spurious term. 

To conclude, the study of CMB polarization and the measurement of $B$ modes polarization represent one of the major challenges in modern cosmology. The detection of $B$ modes can be affected by a leakage effect of temperature into polarization. Here we studied the non-linearities that the leakage from dust temperature can create. We have seen that the non-linearity coefficients are ranged between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5}$.\\

To search for $B$ modes at low tensor-to-scalar ratio, the non-linear coefficient of the detector that we use has to be lower than \eps . In the next section, we will study a systematic effect of KIDs by calculating their non-linearity coefficient, and comparing them to \eps .
