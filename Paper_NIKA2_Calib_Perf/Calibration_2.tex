%\section{Calibration}
%\label{se:calibration}

%We present the calibration of the absolute scale of the flux densities
%for the NIKA2 instrument in this section using Uranus as the main
%primary calibrator. Practically, at the stage of the FOV
%reconstruction (see Sect.~\ref{se:geometry}), an absolute
%coefficient factor per detectors is derived using a \bm\ scan of
%Uranus. This step realizes also the inter-calibration of all the KID,
%as the coefficient factors give the KID gains. Secondly, the flux
%density absolute scale is further refined by monitoring the primary
%calibrator all along the observation campaign to estimate an
%absolute calibration correction.

%We have evidenced a daily variation of the absolute calibration
%coefficients as a function of the observation date, which is related
%to temperature-induced variation of the beam size. If left uncorrected, this variation
%induces a sizable increase of the calibration uncertainties. To
%overcome this issue, we primarily flag the most impacted observation
%dates and exclude the observations acquired during these periods. This
%conservative approach constitutes the baseline calibration method,
%which is further used for the performance assessment. For cross-check,
%we also proposed an alternative method relying on a photometric
%correction depending on the beam size. Both approaches require an
%accurate monitoring of the beam size as a function of the observation
%date.


%First we describe the method for the absolute calibration in
%Sect.~\ref{se:calibration_method}, then we present the
%inter-calibration and the flat fields in
%Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field}. The temperature-induced variation and the
%beam size monitoring are then discussed in
%Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}. Finally, the baseline calibration is
%presented in Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration} and the calibration
%with a photometric correction in
%Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_correction}.

\subsection{Baseline calibration}
\label{se:baseline_calibration}

To assess NIKA2 performance, we rely on a baseline calibration that
resorts to the following steps: i) the calibration in FWHM$_0$ Gaussian
as detailed in Sect.~\ref{se:calibration_method} is implemented, ii)
the effect of the temperature-induced variation of the beam size is
mitigated using the \emph{baseline} scan selection described in
Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection} and iii) the
atmospheric attenuation is corrected using the {\tt corrected skydip}
opacity estimation described in Sect.~\ref{se:corrected-skydip}.

The \emph{baseline} calibration is validated below by checking the
stability of Uranus flux density estimates against the beam size
(Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_scans}) and against the
atmospheric transmission
(Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_atm}). The \emph{baseline}
calibration results are compared on alternative calibration methods
using other opacity correction (Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_opacity}).

%In this section, we check the stability of Uranus flux density
%estimates againts the beam size in
%Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_scans} and againts the
%atmospheric transmission in
%Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_atm}. In
%Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration_opacity}, we compare
%Uranus flux density estimates after absolute calibration using other
%opacity correction methods.

\subsubsection{Flux stability against the beam size}
\label{se:baseline_calibration_scans}

We present the Uranus measured-to-predicted flux density ratio as a
function of the 2D Gaussian FWHM estimates and color-coded from the
observation times given in UT hours in
Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_all}. {\lp As expected from the
discussion in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}, the largest FWHMs are
measured on scans acquired in late afternoon, especially from 16:00 UT
to 21:00 UT.}

\caption[Uranus flux density stability against FWHM]{ Uranus flux
density ratio vs beam size after baseline calibration. The ratio
of Uranus measured flux densities to expectations as a function of the
measured 2D Gaussian beam FWHM is shown for the $1$-mm array
combination (top panel) and for array 2 (bottom panel) after absolute calibration using the
\emph{baseline} method. These plots include all Uranus scans acquired during the 
N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14 campaigns and whose beam FWHMs are below the threshold indicated
by the vertical red lines (open circles), as well as the scans that
met the \emph{baseline} selection criteria (filled circles).}
\label{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_all}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The flux density estimates have been calibrated beforehands, so that
the flux density ratios are equal to unity in average by construction.
We observe no significant dependence of the selected scan flux ratios
(shown as filled circles in Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_all})
on the beam FWHM. {\lp This gives a first indication of the efficiency
  of the \emph{baseline} scan selection to mitigate the
temperature-induced beam variation effect. The flux stability against
the beam FWHM is further assessed in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.}


\subsubsection{Flux stability against the atmospheric transmission}
\label{se:baseline_calibration_atm}

We test the stability of Uranus flux densities calibrated using the
\emph{baseline} method against the atmospheric transmission. The latter
depends on the measured zenith opacity $\taunu$ and the scan
average \airmass\ x as $\exp{(-\taunu \, x)}$. In
the first row of Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_atmtrans}, Uranus flux ratio
is shown as a function of the atmospheric
transmission for the $1$-mm array combination and Array 2 and for the
three \emph{reference} observation campaigns (N2R9, N2R12 $\&$ N2R14). We
observe no significant correlation of the flux ratio with the atmospheric
transmission, which gives a first
indication of the robustness of the flux density estimates against the
atmospheric conditions using the baseline calibration. This will be
further tested using a larger number of scans toward other sources in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.

\subsubsection{Comparison with other opacity correction methods}
\label{se:baseline_calibration_opacity}

As a cross-check we have derived the absolute
calibration factors using the {\tt taumeter}
(Sect.~\ref{se:taumeter-method}) and the {\tt skydip}
(Sect.~\ref{se:skydip-method}) atmospheric opacity
correction methods. We then compare Uranus
flux density estimates after absolute calibration using the baseline
calibration and these two alternative corrections. Figure~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_atmtrans}
shows the Uranus measured-to-modeled
flux ratio as a function of the atmospheric transmission for A1$\&$A3
and for A2 after the {\tt taumeter} correction (second row) and
after the {\tt skydip} correction (third row). We observe more
dispersion for the {\tt taumeter}-based flux ratio, whereas the {\tt
skydip}-based ratio is very similar as the baseline ratio except
for a slight decrease of the flux at low atmospheric
transmission. Thus the {\tt taumeter} and {\tt skydip} atmospheric
opacity correction methods can be used for
the absolute calibration in complement to {\tt corrected skydip}, e.g. to
perform robustness tests as in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.
