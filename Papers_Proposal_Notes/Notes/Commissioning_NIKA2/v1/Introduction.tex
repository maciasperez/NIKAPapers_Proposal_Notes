\end{table} 

This document describes the work accomplished by the NIKA2 consortium in order
to validate the performances of NIKA2. More specifically, the MoU defined
specifications and goals on some key parameters. They are summarized in
Tab~\ref{nika2specs}. Additionnal information on the instrument and ancillary
parameters were also requested by IRAM, together with a document demonstrating
how the performances have been assessed, both in terms of observations and data
reduction. This document is the answer.\\

Table~\ref{nika2runs} summarizes the timeline of NIKA2 integration and tests
since the replacement of NIKA1 by NIKA2 in Oct.~2015. Based on this overview and
the observing conditions, we have focused our analysis on data from
the N2R9 calibration campaign and the N2R12 and N2R14 science pools.
The final results of this commissioning are given in the last section
essentially via a summary table~\ref{tab:nika2summary} with links to the
relevant sections for detailed demonstration of the results.

In order to be self-consistent, the document is also meant to be read in chronological
order. Chapter~\ref{se:chap_instru_obs_methods} summarizes the main features of
the instrument and of the data reduction that will be used in the remaining of
the document for all performance derivations. It also lists and introduces the necessary inputs
that are required for the full data reduction and that are discussed in details
in the following sections.
We start with atmospheric opacity in
chapter~\ref{se:opacities}, then proceed to detector positional offsets in
chapter~\ref{se:fp_reconstruction} and beam characterization in chapter~\ref{se:beams}.
Chapter~\ref{se:calibration} addresses the overall calibration of
observations. At last, chapters~\ref{se:photometry}~and~\ref{se:nefd} address
the final performances of the instrument in terms of photometry and sensitivity,
before the final summary section~\ref{se:summary}.
