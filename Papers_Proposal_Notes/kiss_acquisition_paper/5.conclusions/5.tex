The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and explain the new acquisition technique for KISS. As previously mentioned, this algorithm is naturally implementable for all those instruments that will aim to exploit KID-based interferometers: a worthwhile solution for the contemporary and future multi-wavelength cosmology. Although KISS represents a standalone instrument to make science, it opens future perspectives for larger arrays experiments. Specifically for these cases, in fact, our new algorithm will minimise the data production and contain the inflation on the electronics specifications.
