\section{Stability of the beam pattern {\color{blue} Laurence}}


\subsection{Individual scan beam profiles}

We checked the stability of the beam against various observing
condition (source intensity, weather condition, focus optimisation) by
comparing the beam profile of the beam-map set, which comprizes nine
beam-maps acquired from N2R8 to N2R10, as defined in
Sect.~\ref{se:beammap_set}.
The nine beam profiles and their ratio
w.r.t. the median beam profile are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam_prof}.
