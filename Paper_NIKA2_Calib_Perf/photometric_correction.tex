The \emph{baseline} calibration (Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration}) relies on
the \emph{baseline} scan selection, as defined in Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection},
to focus as much as possible on pure on NIKA2 performances. We have however
investigated ways to mitigate the \afternoon\ beam size variations
(sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}) (not related to the NIKA2 instrument) and
extend the possible range of observing conditions. This section presents one
of them, that relies on the monitoring of the effective FWHM during
observations. It also offers and interesting cross-check of the baseline
calibration.

\subsection{Photometric correction method}
\label{se:photometric_correction_method}

When the beam size broadens due to e.g. \afternoon\ beam effect, the flux
density is smeared in a larger solid angle and the flux density estimator, which
is based on the amplitude fit of a Gaussian beam of fixed FWHM (see
Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}) is biased toward low flux densities.

Indeed, up to a normalization factor, our flux estimator applied to a map
$M(\theta,\phi)$ reads

\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}  = \int \int M(\theta, \phi)\, e^{-\frac{d(\theta,\phi)^{2}}{2\sigma_{0}^{2}}} \sin \theta d\theta d\phi\,,
  \label{eq:flux_density_estimator}
\end{equation}

where $d(\theta,\phi)$ is the angular distance and $\sigma_0$ correspond to
FWHM's of 12.5 and 18.5\,arcsec at 1 and 2\,mm respectively
(sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}). Modelling our observations of a point
source as

\begin{equation}
  M(\theta, \phi) = A e^{-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2\sigma^2}}\,,
  \label{eq:pointsource_map}
\end{equation}

leads to

\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}  = 2\pi \sigma^2 A \,  \frac{\sigma_0^2}{(\sigma^2 + \sigma_0^2)}.
  \label{eq:gaussian_star}
\end{equation}

Assume that we observe the source under stable conditions (\emph{baseline}) and
denote with a $_\star$, the associated amplitude $A_\star$, beam width
$\sigma_\star$ and flux estimate $\hat{S}_\star$. Recalling that pure aperture
photometry ensures energy conservation between two different observations:
$2\pi\sigma^2 A = 2\pi\sigma_\star A_\star^2$, we can now derive the correct
flux estimate $\hat{S}_\star$ from $\hat{S}$, as obtained under unstable conditions:

\begin{equation}
\hat{S}_\star = \frac{\sigma^2 + \sigma_0^2}{\sigma_\star^2 + \sigma_0^2}\hat{S}
\equiv f(\sigma)\hat{S}.
\end{equation}

\nico{Fig.~\ref{fig:f_sigma} shows XXXXXXXXX... $\sigma_\star$ is determined and
chosen as... (See commented text)}\\

%% Considering only the main beam broadening, modeled as a Gaussian of
%% size $FWHM = 2 \sqrt{2\ln{2}} \, \sigma$, we show in
%% Appendix~\ref{ap:photometric_correction_detail} that
%% the flux density estimator depends on {\lp $(\sigma'^2 +\sigma_0^2)$
%%   that is the squared size of the Gaussian
%%   resulting from the convolution} between the enlarged
%% $\sigma '$-Gaussian, which can be monitored as in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}, and the 
%% $\sigma_0$ fixed-width Gaussian of our reference system.
%% 
%% An unbiased
%% flux density $\hat{S}_{\rm{pc}}$ can be derived from the flux density
%% estimate $\hat{S}$ as
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \hat{S}_{\rm{pc}} = f(\sigma')\, \hat{S},
%% \end{equation}
%% where $f(\sigma')$ is a photometric correction for the beam variation
%% effect. Within the Gaussian model, it reads:
%% \begin{equation}
%%   f(\sigma') = \frac{(\sigma'^2 + \sigma_0^2)}{(\sigma_{\star}^2 + \sigma_0^2)}. 
%% \end{equation} 

The beam size in stable atmospheric conditions $\sigma_\star$ is
determined by fitting the 2D Gaussian beam on the series of scans of
source with varying flux densities that have been used for the beam
characterization in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam}. However, $\sigma_\star$
is not equivalent to the main beam Gaussian size since the side lobes
and first error beams are not masked for this beam size
monitoring. The $\sigma_\star$ estimates are slightly
larger for bright sources due to the contribution of the first side
lobes and error beams, which are above the noise level, in the Gaussian fit.

%% An empirical model for the induced correlation of
%% $\sigma_\star$ with the source flux density is given in
%% Appendix~\ref{ap:photometric_correction_detail}.

The photometric correction thus relies on the measure of the current beam size
$\sigma$. The induced uncertainties on the flux density measurements depend on
the precision of the effective beam size determination. We perform two case
studies that correspond to the two beam monitoring methods discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}.\\
%\new{the paragraph titled ``Demonstration case''} presents a demonstration
%calibration assuming the beam is precisely monitored, whereas
%the ``Practical case using pointing scans'' paragraph addresses a practical calibration relying
%on a beam monitoring using pointing scans. 

\noindent \emph{Demonstration case} This method ({\tt PC-demo} hereafter) uses a
photometric correction based on the beam monitoring with bright source
scans. Both the 2D Gaussian FWHM fit and the FWHM$_0$ photometry are performed
on the map of the source. This method thus applies only to point-like sources
that are bright enough for an accurate fit of the beam on a single scan.

To capture only the beam size variations driven by the
observing conditions (primary mirror deformations, anomalous
refraction, elevation), a small correction $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}}$ has to be made to
the 2D Gaussian beam FWHM estimate for bright sources. The estimate of the
actual Gaussian size $\sigma '$ is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\sigma} = \frac{(\rm{FWHM} - \delta_{\rm{FWHM}})}{2\sqrt{2 \ln{2}}}, 
\end{equation} 
where the offset $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}}$ is null for faint or moderately
bright point sources, and non-zero for bright sources.
As for $\sigma_\star$, the 2D Gaussian fit yields slightly broader
FWHM for bright sources (e.g. planets) to accomodate
for the side lobes and error beams that are measured with high signal-to-noise.
For Uranus, $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}}$ includes also the beam widening due
to Uranus disc, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_results}.
%, which is seen with an average diameter of $3.5''$ at the
%IRAM 30-m telescope latitude.
We measure Uranus $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}}$
by comparing the average %$\sigma_{\rm{geom}}$
FWHM estimates using Uranus
scans and using MWC349 scans, we found $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}} = 0.4''$ at
1\,mm and $\delta_{\rm{FWHM}} = 0.25''$ at 2\,mm, which basically
distributes as one half being due to Uranus finite extension and the
other half stemming from the side lobes.\\

\noindent \emph{Practical case using pointing scans} This method ({\tt PC-point}
hereafter) performs a photometric correction based on the beam monitoring with
pointing scans. Unlike {\tt PC-demo}, this method is thus usable even for
sources fainter than about one Jy \nico{but relies on interpolations between beam width estimates on
  other scans}. For Uranus, this value is corrected for the diameter size, as
  in Sect.~\ref{se:mainbeam_results}.
%The actual Gaussian beam size $\sigma '$ is estimated using
%\begin{equation}
%  \hat{\sigma '} = \sigma_{\rm{p}} - \frac{\delta_{\rm{p}}}{2\sqrt{2 \ln{2}}}, 
%\end{equation} 
%where $\sigma_{\rm{p}}$ is the beam size estimate interpolated from
%the pointing-based beam monitoring and the offset $\delta_{\rm{p}}$
%only accounts for the source finite extension. It is null for
%point-like sources and equals to $0.2''$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and $0.13''$
%at $2\,\rm{mm}$ for pointing scan of Uranus.
%No other contribution
%enters $\delta_{\rm{p}}$
No other FWHM offset correction is needed since pointing scan maps
have a low signal-to-noise ratio that prevents the geometrical FWHM
from being significantly affected by the side lobes.

\subsection{Absolute calibration with a photometric correction}

We perform the absolute calibration by i) implementing the practical
method described in Sect.~\ref{se:practical_calib}, ii) correcting the
atmospheric attenuation using the {\tt corrected skydip} opacity
estimates, and iii) using the photometric correction of
Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_correction_method}.

Using the photometric correction alleviates the need of
performing a scan selection based on the observation time. However,
the scans from which the absolute calibration is derived, are selected
on the FWHM estimate using the same criteria as for the baseline
calibration, that are FWHM thresholds of $12.5''$ at $1\, \rm{mm}$ and $18''$ at
$2\, \rm{mm}$. Thus, only the scans that are moderately affected by the beam
effect are included in the absolute calibration in order not to
include twice the photometric correction uncertainties in the error
budget (once for the absolute calibration and once for the photometry).

Figure~\ref{fig:calib_uranus_vs_fwhm_photocorr} presents the Uranus
measured-to-predicted flux density ratio as a function of the beam FWHM
after the photometric correction with the {\tt PC-demo} and
{\tt PC-point} methods. The flux
density is stable against the beam FWHM within uncertainties for both
wavelengths.

We further quantify the
difference between all the calibration methods that have been tested
in evaluating i) the average absolute calibration factor
with respect to the baseline calibration factor and
ii) the rms dispersion of the measured-to-modeled flux ratios. These
quantities are gathered in Table~\ref{tab:Abs_calibration_results_all}
in the rows labeled 'Ratio' and 'RMS' respectively. 

We find that, resorting to a photometric correction i) allows us to use $45\%$ more
scans for the absolute calibration, ii) has a negligible impact on
the absolute calibration factor and iii) yields a small reduction of
the flux density ratio dispersion. For the absolute calibration, the
{\tt PC-point} method performs as well as the {\tt PC-demo} one.
Photometry capability and stability when using a photometric
correction are further tested in Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}.\\
