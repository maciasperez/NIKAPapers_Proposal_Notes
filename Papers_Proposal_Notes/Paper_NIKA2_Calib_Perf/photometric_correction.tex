The effect of the \afternoon\ beam size variations, as discussed
in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}, is mitigated by correcting the measured flux
densities using a beam-size dependent function, referred to as the
photometric correction.

In our reference photometric system, as presented in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}, 
the flux density is estimated by fitting to the data the amplitude of a fixed-width
Gaussian beam:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}  = 2 \int \int M(\theta, \phi)\, e^{-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2\sigma_{0}^{2}}} \sin \theta d\theta d\phi.
  \label{eq:flux_density_estimator}
\end{equation}
The beam width $\sigma_{0}$ corresponds to the
reference FWHM, which we recall, is $12.5''$ for the $1\,\rm{mm}$ arrays and $18.5''$ for
the $2\,\rm{mm}$ array, as defined in Table~\ref{tab:definitions}.

First of all, in stable observing conditions (no beam
broadening effect), the observed map of the source can be modeled by a single Gaussian of
width $\sigma_\star$ corresponding basically to the main beam size and
of amplitude $A_\star$:
\begin{equation}
  M(\theta, \phi) = A_\star e^{-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2\sigma_\star^{2}}}.
  \label{eq:pointsource_map}
\end{equation}
Ingesting Eq.~\ref{eq:pointsource_map} in
Eq.~\ref{eq:flux_density_estimator}, we find that the flux density
estimator depends on the beam size as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}  = 2\pi \sigma_{\star}^2 \, A_{\star} \, \,  \frac{2 \sigma_0^2}{(\sigma_{\star}^2 + \sigma_0^2)}.
\end{equation}
However, the map is calibrated in FWHM$_0$ beam, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:photometric_system}. The absolute calibration factor,
which is evaluating as
$S_{c}(\nu_{0})/\hat{S}_{c}$, has a beam dependency that
compensates the one of the flux density for the source.

On the other hand, if the beam size varies so that the Gaussian part has a size given by
$\sigma'$, the map model rewrites  
\begin{equation}
  M(\theta, \phi) = A'\, e^{-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2\sigma'^{2}}}.
  \label{eq:broader_beam_map}
\end{equation}

The flux density measured using the fixed-width amplitude estimator 
\begin{equation}
  \hat{S'}  =2\pi \sigma'^2 \, A' \, \,  \frac{2 \sigma_0^2}{(\sigma'^2 + \sigma_0^2)}
\end{equation}
presents a beam-dependency which differs from the one of the primary
calibrator, and which is no longer compensated when performing the
absolute calibration.

{\lp In addition, because the flux density is conserved when integrating over the map,
the Gaussian amplitudes verify
\begin{equation}
2\pi \sigma_{\star}^2 \, A_{\star} = 2\pi \sigma'^2 \, A'
\label{eq:gaussian_amplitude}
\end{equation}}

To retrieve an unbiased flux density estimate $\hat{S}_{pc}$, the
flux density estimate $\hat{S'}$ has to be corrected as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}_{pc} = f(\sigma') \, \hat{S'},
\end{equation} 
where the photometric correction is 
\begin{equation}
  f(\sigma') = \frac{(\sigma'^2 + \sigma_0^2)}{(\sigma_\star^2+\sigma_0^2)}, 
\end{equation} 
so that $f(\sigma') = 1$ if $\sigma'=\sigma_\star$.

As discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:beam_variation}, the beam size is
monitored by fitting a 2D Gaussian of freely varying FWHM.
In practice, the pivot Gaussian size $\sigma_{\star}$ thus corresponds
to the nominal size of the 2D Gaussian fit of the beam that is
measured in stable observing conditions. We find it slightly varies with the
source flux density. Whereas it basically corresponds to the main beam
size for faint to moderately bright point source, it is slightly
larger for sources bright enough for the side lobes to be well above
the noise level. The variation of $\sigma_{\star}$ can be seen as a
correction for fitting the complex beam pattern, as presented in
Sect.~\ref{se:fullbeam}, with a single 2D Gaussian of freely varying
size.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:sigma_stable_vs_flux}, we give an
empirical model for the flux dependency of the FWHM derived from
$\sigma_{\star}$: it
smoothly goes from $11.2''$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and $17.4''$ at $2\,\rm{mm}$ for
moderately bright sources to $11.6''$ at $1\,\rm{mm}$ and $17.65''$ at
$2\,\rm{mm}$ at the flux density of Uranus,
then slightly continues increasing for sources brighter than Uranus.
