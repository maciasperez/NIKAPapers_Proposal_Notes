\subsection{Goals of the total power commissioning}
The main goal of the NIKA2 commissioning runs, described below, is to 
characterize the instrument and check its 
performance with respect to the specifications 
described in Table \ref{nika2specs}. 
We also characterize the performance stability 
against various observing conditions and 
assess the methods and the precision with which the performance parameters are measured.

\subsection{Technical campaigns and open pools}
We had 10 commissioning runs for NIKA2 as described in Table~\ref{nika2runs}.

\subsection{Data set for the performance assessment}

The performance assessment relies mainly on data acquired during N2R9, that is the first complete technical campaign for which the instrumental set up was in the final configuration. \\
For stability check through several campaigns, these data are complemented with the two first Open Pools data.
