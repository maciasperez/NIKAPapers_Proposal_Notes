%\section{Scientific context}
%\vspace{-0.3cm}
       {\bf Abstract -- } Clusters of galaxies are invaluable tools
       for measuring cosmological parameters. The SZ effect directly
       measures the baryon pressure inside clusters. We suggest
       optimizing the use of the 30~m telescope with a Time Filler
       proposal that may span several years (called the survey). Here
       we only request time (20~hours) (called the Demo) to
       demonstrate the usefulness of such a survey. The survey is a
       direct follow-up of the {\sl Planck} clusters. It consists in
       mapping the SZ effect at 2~mm with NIKA2, on a {\sl Planck}
       selected sample of intermediate redshift clusters (typically
       0.15 to 0.3) for which many complementary data are
       available. The published end products would be calibrated maps
       of the $y$ Compton parameter and a point-source catalog per
       cluster. Derived parameters include the cluster pressure
       profile, the presence of shocks, substructures, and possibly,
       the total mass and the baryonic mass, in combination with other
       datasets.\\

       %Combined with {\sl Planck} data, we can measure the Hubble Constant and the baryon-to-total mass ratio.



\vspace{-0.1cm} \noindent {\bf \large Scientific context -- } Clusters
of galaxies are the most massive collapsed structures in the
Universe. As early as in 1933, \cite{Zwicky1933} demonstrated that
there was a lot more matter than meets the eye (of optical observers)
in clusters of galaxies. Since then, it has been established that dark
matter dominates the mass budget of clusters of galaxies, the hot gas
being the major baryonic component and the galaxies being a minor
constituent. The hot gas has been thoroughly observed with X-ray
telescopes, the later ones being {\sl XMM} and {\sl Chandra}. The
interaction of the Cosmic Microwave Background with the hot electrons
is called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect (\cite{SZ1972}). It
produces a brightness decrement at the cluster location at the NIKA2
wavelength of 2~mm.  The {\sl Planck} satellite (\cite{PSZ2}), ACT
(\cite{Hilton2021}) and SPT (\cite{Bleem2015}) have produced todate
the biggest catalogs of SZ observations, with thousands of clusters
being measured. The millimetre observations are complementary to
X-rays. The X-ray emissivity is mostly proportional to the square of
the density, whereas the SZ effect is directly sensitive to the
pressure along the line-of-sight and globally, to the total thermal
energy of the cluster. In combination, the two measurements allow
disentangling the density and temperature parameters. At intermediate
redshifts (0.15 to 0.3), the clusters have been well observed by X-ray
satellites. But the SZ picture offers a less biased view of the
baryonic content of a cluster, being only proportional to the density.
%Large SZ cluster surveys, such as those by the ACT (e.g., Hincks et al. 2010 and Marriage et al. 2011), SPT (e.g. Vanderlinde et al. 2010, Carlstrom et al. 2011, Williamson et al. 2011 and Reichardt et al. 2013) and {\sl Planck} (e.g. Tauber et al. 2010 and {\sl Planck} Collaboration et al. 2011) 
Fig.~\ref{Fig:AllSky} (left) shows all the clusters of galaxies
detected by {\sl Planck}: they are everywhere on the sky and therefore
constitute perfect targets for a time-filler ground-based follow-up
survey which is considered here. The large majority of {\sl Planck}
clusters are in the redshift range we are targetting. For many
clusters, the millimetre data are scarce and the complementarity of
that survey with data from reference 2000-2030 missions like {\sl
  Herschel, XMM, Chandra, Euclid, eRosita, LOFAR, SKA, Athena} is
clear. Fig.~\ref{Fig:SZprofile} (right) shows the lack of SZ maps in
the center of clusters of intermediate redshift. The 2~mm signal
typically follows a $(1+\frac{\theta^2}{\theta_c^2 })^{-0.8}$ law,
where $\theta$ is the angular radius to the center and $\theta_c$ is
the angular core radius. The core radius of intermediate redshift
clusters is about 1-2 arcminutes (corresponding to few hundred
kilopc). This is represented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:SZprofile}
(left). Mapping the center of clusters would reveal their dynamical
state and, in particular, if they are perturbed or not, and if they
posess a cool-core (the cooling time is shorter than the Hubble time)
or not (see {\sl e.g.} \cite{Hudson2010}). \\


\vspace{-0.1cm} \noindent {\bf \large Main scientific goals -- } The
proposed survey of SZ mapping of clusters of galaxies will directly
provide: 1-- high angular resolution (18~arcsec) $y$ Compton parameter
maps of well-known clusters. So far, the SZ maps were obtained with a
low to mid resolution beams. For example, the {\sl Planck} beam at
2~mm is 7~arcminute, barely resolving even the biggest clusters. ACT
and SPT have also provided catalogs of clusters of galaxies which also
suffer from mid angular resolution. An early impressive catalog of SZ
maps has been obtained by Carlstrom et al.~(Fig.~\ref{Fig:AllSky}
right) at 15~GHz (OVRO/BIMA, 1.7 to 2.8~arcmin resolution as shown as
a white beam, \cite{Reese2002}). We want to increase by an order of
magnitude that pionneer survey, in terms of the number of clusters,
the frequency and the angular resolution. The proposed maps would
cover only the central part of the clusters. The external part has
already been mapped with unprecedented accuracy by {\sl Planck}. 2-- A
catalog of 2~mm sources. They will be mostly radio sources (e.g. the
Brightest Cluster Galaxy). The submillimetre galaxies will probably
not be detected with the poor sensitivity expected at 1~mm. {\sl
  Herschel} catalogs will be used, wherever available, to take into
account potential contaminations. 3-- Central pressure profiles of a
large sample of clusters. From these profiles and X-ray data from {\sl
  XMM-Newton}, one can infer the baryonic mass (dominated by the hot
plasma outside the galaxies) and the total mass of the cluster, via
the hydrostatic hypothesis, in combination with X-ray and {\sl Planck}
data. 4-- Inhomogeneities can reveal AGN feedback, shocks, X-ray
bubbles and substructures which can be correlated with X-rays and
low-frequency radio surveys (relics, and so on), like LOFAR, and, in
the future, SKA. The main goal of the time-filler survey proposal is
to make a {\sl Planck} ground-based followup, with maps at high
angular resolution of a large sample of the center of individual
clusters. The {\sl Planck} measurement suffers from the very imperfect
knowledge of the cluster size and central details
(\cite{Planck2013PressProf}). This could potentially improve the
accuracy of the {\sl Planck} cosmological constraints coming from
clusters of galaxies.
%If possible, we can also measure the Hubble constant without the use of the canonical cosmic ladder and study the substructures within clusters of galaxies. For example, Reese etal (2002) used 18 clusters, observed with OVRO/BIMA, to determine the Hubble constant as $60\pm4\mathrm{km s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$, with a systematic error error bar 4 times larger.\\
%Other outputs of this survey include serendipitous ones: odd sources,map features.
A sure output will be a complementary dataset on clusters, which are
be studied at many other wavelengths.  For instance, the observed
clusters will largely overlap with the targets of the large {\sl XMM}
heritage programme by~\cite{ChexMate2020}, a {\sl Planck} selected
sample of 118~clusters in our range of redshifts. Another program,
with {\sl Chandra}, is dealing with 169~clusters (ESZ sample with
$z<0.35$)). Most clusters have available optical data too. We intend to publish
the survey results in an open database. Cluster maps would be public
within a year of observations. In relation to the ongoing Guaranteed
Time NIKA2 SZ Large Program on clusters of galaxies, we think that it
is very complementary because: here we aim at intermediate redshift
clusters (0.15 to 0.3) which are more extended and observed in a
shallow mode, whereas the LPSZ survey aims at high redshift ($z\ge
0.5$) clusters observed with high sensitivity down to their edges, and
with a thorough control of sources that can perturb the maps (hence
their importance for the 1~mm channel). Other instruments have already
followed-up on {\sl Planck} clusters in order to make SZ maps at
better resolutions: {\sl AMI} (a UK 15~GHz interferometer) in
particular, has been used, and provided observations of 123~clusters,
including 99~detections (\cite{Perrott2015}), each observation
requiring 60~hours of integration with a limited angular resolution of
3~arcminutes.\\

\vspace{-0.1cm} \noindent {\bf \large Feasability and Sample selection
  -- } Observing intermediate redshift clusters requires to map
angular scales of the order of the NIKA2 field-of-view. The findings
within the NIKA2 collaboration is that scales scanned within less than
3~seconds can be recovered while larger scales suffer from various
low-frequency noises (sky noise and electronic noise mostly) that are
difficult to remove with decorrelation techniques. Scanning fast
``freezes'' the atmosphere and other noises. With a FOV diameter of
390~arcsec, it becomes important to map at a speed larger than about
100~arcsec/s. With 150~arcsec/s, the sampling of NIKA2 (at the
standard 23~Hz acquisition) is 6.5~arcsec which is not really
compatible with Nyquist sampling of the 12~arcsec 1~mm beam. Whenever
necessary, we should therefore go to the fast NIKA2 acquisition rate
(46~Hz) which is used in the polarimetric mode, without enabling the
half-wave plate here. Operationnally, the time for switching to the
fast rate is of a few minutes, with the restart of the acquisition
system. A speed of 160~arcsec/s is within the 30~m capabilities
without loss of pointing accuracy (J.~Peñalver, private comm.). We
show in Fig.~\ref{Fig:1sqdegMap} an example of such a scanning speed
capability. In this Demo proposal, we request observing the targets
given in the Table in order to have a demonstration opportunity. The
chosen clusters all have deep X-ray data both from {\sl XMM} (of
similar angular resolution to NIKA2) and {\sl Chandra} (of better
angular resolution, and useful for identifying bubbles, ripples, cold
fronts, and other subtle features that might be picked up by
NIKA2). All clusters (but A1413) show diffuse low frequency radio
emission. With this Demo proposal, we want to show that the full
time-filler survey can be done with the requirements that we need: 1)
the scan speed can increase the recovery of large angular scales and
the images are reproducible, even though the opacity is mediocre, 2)
the pointing can have very relaxed requirements with only 4~arcsec 3)
the sky noise can be tackled with (as discussed above), 4) the survey
is insensitive to the 1~mm conditions, 5) the beam must not be perfect
but reproducible, 6) anomalous refraction should be limited. 7)
opacity correction does not limit the calibration accuracy. This Demo
program must quantify to which extent the clusters can be mapped in a
snapshot mode. They contain a fair sample of `canonical' clusters to
be published in a standalone article .

We need to achieve a $y$ sensitivity below $10^{-4}$ for one beam
(FWHM of 18~arcsec) so that the center of the cluster (typically with
a central $y$ of $3\times 10^{-4}$) can be well mapped. The size of
the clusters being below 8~arcmin, scans of 20 by 12 arcmin at 4
different orientations (0, 45, 90, 135~degrees) in Ra-Dec coordinates
are required to obtain a central 12~arcmin diameter map and enough
blank fields around to set the zero level (in agreement with the IRAM
recommendations). With a maximal azimuth speed of the telescope of
170~arcsec/s, an effective sky scanning speed of 120 (resp. 83)
arcsec/s can be achieved at an elevation of 45 (resp. 60) degrees. The
trade-off between speed and opacity (due to the low elevation) will
have to be made on a cluster-to-cluster basis. The integration time
can be roughly estimated by assuming an average mediocre zenith
opacity of 0.5 at 2~mm (0.75 for the 225~GHz IRAM taumeter!) and an
elevation of 45~degrees so that the sensitivity becomes
$20\,\mathrm{mJy.s^{1/2}}$ per detector. The conversion from Jy to $y$
involves a factor 12 so that the $y$ $1\,\sigma$ sensitivity for
1~hour is $20\times 10^{-3}/12/\sqrt{3600\times 0.7}=2.3\times
10^{-5}$ for one field-of-view and adopting 0.7 for the number of
valid Kids. The scan involves an area of $20\times
12\,\mathrm{arcmin^2}$ which covers 7~FOV, so the final sensitivity of
the central 12~arcmin map, after 2~hours (total integration time),
will be, in $y$ terms, of $2.3\times 10^{-5}\sqrt{7/2}=4.3\times
10^{-5}$. Even after accounting for diffuse vs. point-source
sensitivities, this is well below the target sensitivity of
$10^{-4}$. It would provide a Signal-to-Noise ratio at the peak of 10
per beam (depending on the central strength of the cluster), while the
signal covers several
square-arcminutes. Fig.~\ref{Fig:SZprofile}~(left) shows a typical
profile and error bars in annuli that are expected for massive
clusters. Including an overhead of 2 for calibration and pointing, the
demonstration of the time-filler proposal could be done with the
observation of 5~clusters, each of them with a duration of 4~hours. We
therefore request {\bf 20~hours} of observations with NIKA2, using
only the weather conditions where standard NIKA2 proposals cannot be
scheduled. This project could be a pathfinder projects for other
large-scale 2~mm mapping projects. The team has a lot of experience in
the data reduction of different datasets: X-rays, {\sl Planck},
optical, and SZ maps of clusters of galaxies with NIKA and NIKA2, with
a planned reuse of available IDL sofware
(\href{https://ipag.osug.fr/nika2/Publications.html}{NIKA2 consortium
  publications}).  {\sl According to the published commissioning
  results of the NIKA2 instrument, the total observing time using the
  NIKA2 2~mm band to map a region of 240.0 [arcmin$^2$] to reach an
  rms of 0.4~[mJy/beam], assuming 9.0~[mm] pwv, 45.0~[deg] elevation,
  Filter = 1.0, Overhead = 2.0, was estimated to be 3.8~hours, using
  the time estimator v 2020.JUL.22. The rms of 0.4~mJy is slightly
  below the above $y_{rms}=4.3\times 10^{-5}$}


The initial table of clusters for the whole survey is made of
400~entries (Fig.~\ref{Fig:RelTau} right) from the {\sl Planck}
catalog. Of course, any source which is being scheduled for other open
time proposals would be withdrawn from the whole time-filler proposal,
but we do not expect to see many cases of fencing. Some {\sl ACT}
clusters may also be included.  Fig.~\ref{Fig:RelTau} (left)
illustrates that the opacity is between 0.4 and 0.7 for 25~\% of the
30~m time (0.25, 0.5 at 2~mm). Accounting for typically 3~months of
NIKA2 operations, the expected total integration time for this survey
could be of 500 hours per year, allowing to map hundreds of clusters
in several years (with a rolling proposal). The Demo time-filler
proposal is here intended to show the capability of recovering the
diffuse emission of clusters of galaxies. It will allow to ascertain
the feasability of the survey time-filler proposal that we will then
submit, if the results are satisfactory. This survey would optimize
the use of the NIKA2 instrument with a direct public legacy.\\

  \caption{{\bf Left}~Radial profile of the SZ effect for a massive
    cluster (typically A2163) with a core radius of one arcminute. Two
    models are shown, the $\beta$ one being in black (derived from SZ
    data by \cite{Reese2002}) and the X-ray derived model from
    \cite{Arnaud2010} in yellow. Error bars for NIKA2 measurements in
    annuli are shown as diamonds (after 2 hours of observations). The
    recovery of large angular scales will be more difficult beyond the
    dashed line (8~arcmin diameter). {\sl Planck} clusters are on
    average less bright (2 to 10 times) than the example shown
    (A2163). The integration time will be modulated with each
    cluster. {\bf Right}~Average radial pressure profile obtained from
    several {\sl Planck} clusters. The inner part is not well-known in

    non-cool-core clusters.}

\caption{One square-degree 2~mm NIKA2 map obtained with a fast raster scan
  (color scale in Jy/beam). It is centered on a typical 30~m pointing
  source.  The map covers more a one-degree square. It is made by
  co-adding 4 scans, each scan covering the total area either at +45
  or -45 degrees from azimuth. This test case was obtained, just
  before enabling a polarization commissionning session, when the
  opacity was 0.57 at 1~mm and 0.33 at 2~mm for an elevation of
  34~degrees, conditions which are far from acceptable for normal
  scientific observations. The scan speed was 150~arcsec/s to cover
  60~arcmin per subscan (times 21~subscans to cover 60 arcmin in the
  cross direction). The scan duration was 10~minutes. The central
  source is well detected with a 2.8~Jy flux at 2~mm and a FWHM of
  less than 18~arcsec, {\sl i.e.} no beam smearing effect from the
  scan speed and the same flux as with a standard scan speed map. A
  serendipitous source of about $46\pm6\,\mathrm{mJy}$ is found within
  5~arcsec of a Radio and WISE Source (WISEA J035933.92+511521.2 has a
  1.4~GHz flux of 24~mJy)}
