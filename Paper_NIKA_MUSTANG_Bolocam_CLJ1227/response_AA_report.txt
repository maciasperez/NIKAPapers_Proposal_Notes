(1) Comparison with alternative deprojection methods:
  The referee has two comments here.
  (a) The referee asks that I better contextualize my method with respect to the literature.
  (b) The referee rightfully identifies a misnomer of "maximum likelihood", given that with Bayesan terminology, we are not maximizing the *likelihood*, but the (marginalized) posterior distribution.

  In regards to these comments, we have added a discussion at the beginning of Section 3 that better contextualizes our approach with respect to other approaches. Furthermore, we have rectified our terminology throughout the paper, stating that we maximize the posterior distribution.

(2) Covariance estimation:
  The referee indicates that the covariance estimation employed assumes that the posterior distributions (pressure profile bin values) are well described by Gaussian distributions, but in fact Table 2 shows that the distributions are assymetric. We find that the residuals of individual points (Figure 6), which include the assymetric error bars, are not heavily biased by the assumed covariance matrix. Rather, we note that if symmetric error bars from the diagonal of the covariance matrix were used, the residuals would have a more pronounced bias towards the negative values.

  Given that assymetries of up to ~30% are found in table 2, and correlations up to 13% are found in MUSTANG data, we recognize that it is likely more of a concern to account for the assymetries. We reiterate that we do not believe this has adversely affected our conclusions in this work. The text in Section  4 has been updated accordingly.

(3) Comparison with external datasets:
  The referee notes that the results presented in the paper have not be contextualized with respect to the literature.

We have further contextualized our results in our discussion section (Section 6).

(5) Section 3.3: The detailed discussion of the MCMC method has been removed

(6) Section 3.4: An F-test and difference in chi^2 test have been performed and the text updated accordingly.

(7) Section 3.4: A Y_cyl prior is assumed on NIKA.

(8) Section 4: We have clarified that the outer bins are removed due to the failure to recover the input pressure bins.

(9) Section 4: Although no precise correlation values from Sayers+ 2013 are provided, we conservatively quantify the correlation present from the figure they present.
