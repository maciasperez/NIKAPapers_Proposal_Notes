The measurement of CMB polarization, and especially the detection of B modes, is
one of the major challenges in modern cosmology. In fact, a key motivation for
CMB polarization measurements is the theory of cosmic inflation. B modes can be
generated by two mechanisms : gravitational lensing of E modes
\citep{2013PhRvL.111n1301H}, or by gravitational waves produced during
inflation. The detection of primordial B modes would represent an indirect
detection of primordial gravitational waves, and as a result, establish the
theory of cosmic inflation.\\ In order to detect B modes, we need to study the
universe at high resolution and high sensitivity. To do so, the development of
large detectors arrays is required.  The most used kind of detectors are
bolometers named Transition Edge Sensors (TES), but now their performances are
limited by the photon noise. It is possible to do medium-sized arrays of TES
detectors (1000 pixels), but developing larger arrays gets complicated for
technical and economical reasons. Other detectors used are Cold Electron
Bolometer (CEB) \citep{2007stt..conf...93K} and Superconducting Tunnel Junctions
(STJ) but they face difficulties in the fabrication process making them not
suitable for large arrays. Bolometers have enjoyed considerable technical
improvements but further array scaling is strongly limited by the multiplexing
factor of the readout electronics, consequently it was necessary to develop
detectors adapted to strong frequency domain multiplexing.\\ In this context, a
new kind of detectors were developed : the Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs),
proposed by \citet{2003Natur.425..817D}. Since 2007, these detectors were
developed for the construction of NIKA2 and its prototype NIKA (New IRAM Kids
Arrays), which is the first operational instrument using KIDs
\citep{2010A&A...521A..29M,2016JLTP..184..816C}. The main characteritic that
makes KIDs one of the best candidate to large size detector array is their
natural multiplexing capability. Indeed, the resonant frequencies of a resonator
can be easily controlled during the array design, and the sharpness of the
resonances allows many resonators to be placed into a limited band-width. Thus,
a large number of resonators, can be coupled on a single transmission line, each
one resonating at a different frequency $f_{0}^{i}$ \citep{2010A&A...521A..29M,
  Calvo2008}.\\ Current and planned observations of the CMB polarization
requires a very demanding control of systematics effect. In fact, due to its
faintness, The B-mode polarization can be easily degraded by various systematics
effects and it is important to remove these spurious contributions. Some of
these effects can be reduced in the design of the instruments while others have
to be simulated and corrected a posteriori. Numerous systematics effects arise
from optical and instrumental imperfections, temperature drifts of the optics
and detectors, contaminations by astrophysical foregrounds and te detector
non-linearity. These effects can be modelled and characterized by the spurious
signal $C_{l}$ they produce. For more details see \citep{2008PhRvD..77h3003S,
  quickpol} and references therein.\\ KIDs are a new technology which are now
routinely used in ground-based telescopes. However, in view of futur
utilizations above the atmosphere, we still have to demonstrate their
compatibility with a space mission (such as COrE \citep{2016arXiv160907263D}),
hence the need to master their sytematic effects. In this paper, we adress a few
specific systematics to KIDs. The paper is organized as follows:
Sect. \ref{sec2} presents a brief description of KIDs...



%Remi Adam La structure finale est obtenue par lithographie UV. De part le principe de fonctionnement des détecteurs, les KIDs sont simplement disposés en matrices et couplés sur la même ligne de transmission : c’est le principe du multiplexage, qui consiste à transmettre plusieurs signaux dans un même canal de transmission en allouant une bande de fréquence à chaque pixel [35]. Cela impose que les résonances soient nettement séparées pour éviter les chevauchements, dû à la dispersion de fabrication.

% a KID consists of a high-quality superconducting resonant circuit electromagnetically coupled to a transmission line.
