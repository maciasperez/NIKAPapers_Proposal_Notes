\section{Aperture Photometry Calibration {\color{blue} Jean-Fran\c cois}}

To be discussed in this section: the aperture photometry method, the conversion factor between Gaussian Beam photometry and aperture photometry and as example, some stability tests on Planets using aperture photometry

The aperture photometry method that was used to derive the first calibration results as reported in~\cite{Adam18} is detailed in Sect.~\ref{ap:cal_JFL}.
