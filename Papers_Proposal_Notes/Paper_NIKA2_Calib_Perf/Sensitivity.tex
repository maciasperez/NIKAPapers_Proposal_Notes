%\section{Sensitivity}
%\label{se:sensitivity}
%\input{Sensitivity.tex}

In this section, we derive the on-sky sensitivity of the instrument
using a large amount of observation scans, including deep integration
on faint sources, to assess our result stability against the observing
conditions. We evaluate the noise equivalent flux
density, NEFD hereafter, that is the flux density
$1\,\sigma$ errors in one second of effective
on-source telescope integration time after the baseline calibration
has been performed, as described in
Sect.~\ref{se:baseline_calibration}. The first step for
the NEFD measurement is thus an accurate evaluation of the on-source
integration time, which is addressed in
Sect.~\ref{se:integration_time}. Then, for robustness test of the NEFD
estimates, we have devised several methods for estimating the NEFD. A
detailed description of our methods, as well as an application to a
faint source blind detection, will be found in
\citet{Ponthieu2019}. In Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}, we briefly
present the NEFD estimation methods that have been used and the data
sets that have been selected. Finally, the NEFD estimates and the
results of the robustness tests we performed are reported in
Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_results}.


\subsection{Estimation of the time of integration}
\label{se:integration_time}

Considering an observation scan of a point-like source, from which we
produce a map by projecting the calibrated TOI (see
Sect.~\ref{se:dataproc}) into pixels of size $\Delta r$, we primarily
estimate the time of integration on-source, which is the integration
time in a beam $t_{\rm{beam}}$, using
%
\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm{beam}} = \frac{<N_{\rm{hit}}>_{\rm{center}}}{f_{\rm{sam}}}\,
  \frac{g^2}{\eta\Delta_r^2},
  \label{eq:integration_time}
\end{equation}
%
where $N_{\rm{hit}}$ is the so-called hit map, that is the map of the
TOI sample count per map pixels, and $<N_{\rm{hit}}>_{\rm{center}}$
is the average of the hit map over the pixels within a FWHM radius
from the center of the map. The ratio of this quantity to the sampling
frequency $f_{\rm{sam}}$ thus corresponds to the total time of integration
spend in a map pixel of the center of the map. As all the KIDs of an
array produce a data sample at the same time, we need to correct the
total time of integration from the fraction of the KID that
contributes to a map pixel at the same time. For this purpose, first
we estimate the number of KID per map pixel as the ratio of the map
pixel area $\Delta_r^2$ to the KID occupation area $g^2$, where $g$ is
the distance between neighbour KIDs (see
Sect.~\ref{se:grid_distortion}). Then, we multiply
this quantity by the fraction of valid KID $\eta$ that actually
contribute to the map (see
Sect.~\ref{se:avg_kidpar}). {\color{magenta} Clarifier si $\eta$ est
  le nb de valid KID ou le nb de used KID dans le pipeline.}

For cross-checks, we compare the $t_{\rm{beam}}$ estimates using an
alternative approach for evaluating the on-source integration
time based on geometrical considerations. Namely, we calculate the
fraction of the scanning time during which the point source in within
an effective FOV radius, which is defined as the FOV covered by the
valid KIDs. We find the two methods to give comparable integration
time estimates to better than $5\%$. We conclude the $t_{\rm{beam}}$
estimates to be reliable and use it for the NEFD derivation.  


\subsection{NEFD estimation methods and source selection}
\label{se:nefd_method}

We have devised three complementary methods for the
NEFD estimation, which come in two different flavours. First, we
use deep integrations on faint sources, and second we resort to 
joint analysis of multiple scans without combining them. An
extensive discussion of these methods will be given in
\citet{Ponthieu2019}. In this section, we briefly describe one method
for each of the two approaches: \\

\noindent \emph{Deep integration method:} The error on the flux
density of a point source for an integration time $t$ is
$\sigma_\phi(t) = NEFD/\sqrt{t}$. Using long-time integration
observation on a source, we can study the decrease of $\sigma_\phi$
with increasing $t$, and therefore estimate the NEFD if the
different elevation and opacity conditions of observations are
correctly accounted for.
We produce a series of maps using an inverse-variance co-addition of
more and more observation scans, and perform a photometric analysis on
each map according to Sect.~\ref{se:photometry}. Since all the scans
are not acquired in the exact same conditions of atmospheric opacity
and observing elevation, they do not contribute with the same weight
to the co-addition. To derive the top-of-atmosphere NEFD, quoted
NEFD$_0$, we account for the scan-to-scan weighting variations by fitting
the $1\sigma$ flux errors with
\begin{equation}
  \sigma(n) = \frac{NEFD_0}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}t_i e^{-2\tau_i/\sin\delta_i}}},
  \label{eq:sigma_tau_w8}
\end{equation}
where $t_i$, $\tau_i$ and $\delta_i$ are the integration time, the
zenith opacity and the observing elevation of the $i$-th scan of the
$n$-scan co-addition. The quantity $\sum_{i=1}^{n}t_i
e^{-2\tau_i/\sin\delta_i}$ thus consists in an
estimate of the effective integration time for the series of scans
that enter the $n$-scan co-addition. \\

\noindent \emph{Scatter method:} Performing photometry on each
individual scan, we can estimate the sensitivity on the central flux
and measure the time of integration using
Eq.~\ref{eq:integration_time}, hence derive the NEFD for this
scan. After correction of the attenuation of the atmosphere, the joint
analysis of a series of scans provides us with an estimate of the
top-of-atmosphere NEFD. \\

The selection of the source target for the NEFD derivation is
primarily based on the flux density. Indeed, noise
characterization may be biased by residuals of a strong source and the
instrument far side lobes. For the scatter method, we therefore
restrict the analysis to sources with a flux below 1\,Jy. For the deep
integration method, we further need to select a single source whose
visibility allows for long integration time. During the N2R9 campaign,
we selected \hls\, which is a
moderately faint source \citep{hls_combes}, expected to be
74.5\,mJy at 1mm and 15.7\,mJy at 2mm (M.~Bethermin, private
communication). It has been observed for about 9\,h in total over
three nights using 8x5~arcmin$^2$ OTF scans of various orientations.

\subsection{NEFD estimation and robustness tests}
\label{se:nefd_results}

%  comparison entre methods
First we test the stability of the NEFD estimates using the two
methods on a same data set. In Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods}, we
present an application of the deep integration method (left panel) and
the scatter method (right panel) on
%the NEFD estimates for Array 1, 3, the combination of A1$\&$A3
%and Array 2 using
the series of \hls\ observation scans.

The left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} shows the flux density
uncertainties as a function of the integration time. This plot has
been obtained as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}. The small
variations of the slope of the $1\sigma$ flux errors, which are
visible on the plot, correspond to variations of line-of-sight opacity
during the integration. These variations are taken into account for
evaluating the top-of-atmosphere NEFD using
Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma_tau_w8}. The NEFD estimates for Array 1, 3, the
combination of A1$\&$A3 and Array 2 using the deep  
integration method are given in the first row of
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

  than a thousand scans, which distribute as 202, 481 and 430 scans of
  N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14 respectively.}

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In addition, we verify that the noise integrates down as expected with
respect to the integration time. Black lines in the left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} show the $1\sigma$ error fit with the
inverse of the square root of the integration time. The noise
integration is well consistent with $t^{-1/2}$.

The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:nefd_twomethods} show the NEFD
estimates for  Array 1, 3, the combination of A1$\&$A3 and Array 2
using the scatter method, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method},
as a function of the line-of-sight opacities, $\tau/sin(\delta)$,
where $\tau$ is the zenith opacity and $\delta$ the observing
elevation. The solid lines show the best fit of the model for a
background-dominated sensitivity,
defined as NEFD = NEFD$_0$ exp${[\tau/sin(\delta)]}$. The best-fitting
NEFD$_0$ amplitude give us estimates of the
top-of-atmosphere NEFD, which are gathered in
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

We observe systematically higher NEFD for A1 compared to
A3, which is a mainly due to the dichroic-induced 'shadow effect' that
also impacts the flat fields, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{se:flat_field}. Furthermore, the NEFDs are well consistent
with being background dominated for each array and each observing
wavelength. 


%  comparison entre datasets
As a second robustness test, we check the stability of the NEFD for
three observation campaigns. Figure~\ref{fig:nefdvsbackground_below_1Jy} shows the
measured NEFD using the scatter method (see Sect.~\ref{se:nefd_method}) for the
sub-Jansky sources acquired at the N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14
campaigns. The NEFD estimates for the
three campaigns are in agreement within uncertainties for the whole
range of line-of-sight opacities that have been tested.
The solid lines show the expected dependance with
exp${[\tau/sin(\delta)]}$ for a background-limited sensitivity
model. Since the measured NEFD are not Gaussian distributed, we
derive the top-of-atmosphere NEFD as the median of the measured NEFD
per scans after correction of the atmospheric attenuation, which provides us
with a more robust estimate compared to a fit. The NEFD$_0$ estimates
are given in Table~\ref{tab:nefd_summary}.

Combining the data set of N2R9, N2R12 and N2R14 campaigns,
more than one thousand observations scans of sub-Jy sources meet the
baseline selection criteria (see Sect.~\ref{se:data_selection}),
providing us with robust NEFD estimates that are representative of
average NIKA2 performance, which are gathered in
Table~\ref{tab:nefd_astro}.
The RMS uncertainties are evaluated as the rms scatter of the
individual NEFD estimates after correction with
$\exp[\tau/sin(\delta)]$. These values are then extrapolated at the
reference IRAM observing conditions, which consists of $2~\rm{mm}$
of precipitable water vapor (pwv) in the atmosphere and $60$ degrees
elevation.

  with the line-of-sight opacity as solid curves using the median
  zenith opacity derived from all the scans acquired during a campaign.}

\subsubsection{Mapping speed}

To further estimate the mapping capabilities, we also evaluate the
mapping speed $M_{\rm{s}}$, which is defined as the sky area
$\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}$ that can
be mapped at a noise level $\Delta_\sigma$ of $1\,\rm{mJy}$ in an
integration time $\Delta_t$ of one hour, using
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm{s}} = \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\rm{scan}}}{\Delta_\sigma\Delta_t} = \eta \, \frac{\pi}{4} d_{\rm{FoV}}^2 \, \frac{1}{\rm{NEFD}^2},
\end{equation}
where $d_{\rm{FoV}} = 6.5'$ is the FoV diameter, $\eta$ the
fraction of valid KIDs, as given in Tab.~\ref{tab:number_of_kids} in
Sect.~\ref{se:fov_geometry}. This indicates the speed at which the sky
can be surveyed at a flux density rms error level of $1\,\rm{mJy}$.
The top-of-atmosphere mapping speed, which is extrapolated at zero opacity, and the astronomer
mapping speed, which is extrapolated at the reference IRAM observing conditions, are
given in Table~\ref{tab:nefd_astro}.
